            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T muſt not ſeeme ſtrange (moſt Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>GOD,</hi> and my much beloued Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) if, ſeeing the Captaines of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be gone forth to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antichriſt, a Souldier of a meaner rancke, moued with the goodneſſe of the cauſe, enter the battaile, and ioyne himſelfe to the ſtandard. For all doe ſee the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the old warres, and cannot reſt quiet, but aſſayes by all meanes,<note place="margin">Papiſtas noſtros, noſtras dicerem.</note> how he may recouer the poſſeſsion of <hi>GREAT BRITAINE</hi> being loſt, and in a vaine hope thereof our Papiſts in the maſculine, (I ſhould haue ſaid in the feminine but that I ſhould ſeem to ſome
<pb facs="tcp:15182:3"/> to haue ſpoken falſe Latine) are growne more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and farre more inſolent then they were wont here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Who then; though he be the meaneſt ſeruant of Chriſt borne vnder, or rather with the Goſpell reſtored, without which he would not deeme Paradiſe it ſelfe to be a pleaſant Country; would not reſiſt and withſtand to his teeth Antichriſt himſelfe renewing his forces, and taking courage vnto him with ſuch earneſtneſſe, to recouer that ſeat from whence aforetime he was iuſtly caſt out? I was not ignorant what labours were to bee vndertaken, what wronges were to be digeſted, by them who enter combate, and maintaine fight with ſo cruell an enemie: ſo that it were better for them to be ſilent, if they thought what were auaileable rather for their owne priuate, then for the publicke eſtate of the Church of Chriſt. But that which vſually falles out in warre, that the tried proweſſe of the Captaines doth by their enſample whet on the courages of the Souldiers, and doth ſtirre vp and pricke forward their ſluggiſh mindes to the effecting of ſome exploite: The very ſame doth happen to Gods Miniſters in this ſpirituall warfare, to whom there is abilitie giuen from God, to ſome greater, to ſome leſſe, to all ſome. Whereby though they can adde nothing to the matters in controuerſie, and it may bee they ought not: becauſe <hi>not new things are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by Diuines, but after a new manner as</hi> Vincentius <hi>wrot, nor with a diuers faith, but with a diuers ſtile as</hi> Auſten <hi>warneth:</hi> yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both by the conſent of their teſtimony, &amp; with the difference of their giftes and the varietie of diſcourſe they can and ought giue their helping hand to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. That was alſo an encouragement that aſſoone as
<pb facs="tcp:15182:3"/> the beaſt wounded with the kings ſpeare began to grunt,<note place="margin">Bellarmine Parſons. Pacenius. Chriſtano: Becan. Coquaeus, and many others.</note> it preſently caſt vp out of his mouth a great ſwarme of <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who ſhould not ſo much refute with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as traduce with ſlanders, written with the hand of ſcorpions, the Kings maieſtie, being not onely the beſt of Kings, but the beſt of men, and vndoubtedly <hi>the true Defender of the Faith.</hi> Right Heretickes; <hi>who murther men not with the ſword, but with their wiles,</hi> as <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth: for a mans ſtyle may bee counted aſwell a cutthroate, as a ſworde drawne againſt Kings, whoſe honour ſeemes to be more deare and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto them then their liues. So that <hi>Iames Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Francis Rauillacke,</hi> were no more cruell in wounding the Kings body, then <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Pace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in wounding the Kings name. It is ſaid that Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke Rome did imprint that letter, whereof <hi>Cicero</hi> makes mention not to the table of iudges, as diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, but as <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> to the head and forehead of falſe accuſers; to the leaden head, and iron forehead, that they may carry countenances as ſtigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſlaues branded with the markes of thoſe letters in diſgrace of their ſlanderous tongues, whom <hi>Plautus</hi> doth therefore tearme <hi>litered men.</hi> Truely it may ſeeme very vniuſt, if I doe not deſire that thoſe Ieſuits ſhould be accompted <hi>litered,</hi> whom popiſh Rome doth nouriſh and cheriſh within her, as thoſe old <hi>geeſe,</hi> and <hi>dogges,</hi> who by their cackling and barking, did purſue any that aſſaulted the capitall. Adde that thoſe two ſtaues, whereof <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Prophet maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>the authority of Magiſtrates, and the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and agreement of Subiects,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Za: cap. 1. verſ. 7.</note> 
               <hi>calling the one the ſtaffe of beauty, the other the ſtaffe of
<pb facs="tcp:15182:4"/> bondes,</hi> Theſe graceleſſe Ieſuits endeauour to breake them both, making rebellion an Arittle of their faith, wherein they goe ſo farre that they be not only conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of our ſide, but euen of their owne. For of late certaine ſecular Prieſts as they are called, more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in ſhew then the reſt, that they may the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſe abroad cloſly among vs the ſeedes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, do cunningly inueigh againſt the Articles of treaſon, brought in by the Ieſuits; whenas <hi>Alan</hi> and many other ſecular Prieſts do both command and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe treaſon. Our men therefore both as good <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triottes</hi> and as faithfull Miniſters, being bound with the double bond of warfare, euery one of them for his Graces, for his time and place, much more for his power ought to oppugne both theſe Articles, whereby we may maintaine according to our vocations the liberty of the kingdome, vnder which we were borne, together with the truth of the Goſpell by which we were borne again. Wherein the moſt learned Byſhoppe of <hi>Elye</hi> doth very iuſtly taxe the Miniſters that are luke-warme and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a buſineſſe of ſuch importance,<note place="margin">Epiſt Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. to the KING.</note> who do not beſtow their paines in writing, <hi>when as this cauſe,</hi> as hee ſaith, <hi>is to be reckoned among thoſe, wherein he that gathereth not with Chriſt, doth ſcatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with the enemie of Chriſt; wherein if any man ſhall not deliuer his faithfull knowledg, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And doth adde this, that in ſuch a buſines you were better want power then will, and abilitie then faithfulneſſe.</hi> Which I remember was ſometime tould me of that moſt Reuerend Archbyſhoppe D. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then when the quarrell on both ſides was not ſo hot, when hee wiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:15182:4"/> that in ſo great a plenty of excellent Diuines among vs there were more that would imploy their ſpare times from their duty of preaching, in the paines of writing. I am come therefore into the fielde being thereto prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the goodneſſe of the cauſe, the enſample of the Captaines, the iniury of the enemie, the Oath of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, the encouragement of the Fathers, that I might ſomewhat daunt the enemie, inſulting ſo vnworthily.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe I thought good to ſet this taske to my ſelfe, that I might lay open the new creede of faith, gathered out of the new Articles of faith both open and ſecret by the Byſhoppe of Rome himſelfe, not ſo much for our owne Countrimen that are Papiſts, whom if ſo many bookes ſo excellently ſet foorth in Engliſh cannot ſatisfie, nothing at all can ſatisfie; as in a Latine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue for their ſakes that are in forrain parts. And this Dialogue is diuided into three bookes, whereof two of them are now ſet forth, the third God willing, which at this time lieth in ſcattered papers, if my health will permit ſhall be committed to print aſſoone as may be. In all which I firſt bring in a certaine Ieſuite <hi>Robert Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine</hi> a turbulent and wicked fellow, who with his choiſeſt arguments doth egerly defend hereſie and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And I ioyne with him for an anſwerer <hi>Antonius Patriotta</hi> an Orthodoxall Diuine.<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> You know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Dialogues, that men ſpeake thoſe things in them, which they neuer ſpake. Therefore <hi>Saturnine</hi> will happily complaine, that thoſe things are laid to his charge which he neuer ſpake, whenas I dare religiouſly affirme, that this factious Prieſt doth not vſe onely the arguments of the chiefeſt Ieſuits, but their methode and their wordes, chiefly of <hi>Alan, Bellarmine</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:15182:5"/> 
               <hi>Parſons,</hi> that any of them in all things may ſeeme to be <hi>Robert Saturnine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue prefixed before the Dialogue a true looking-glaſſe for the Pope, <hi>i.</hi> a liuely picture of Antichriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically drawne out by <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the antient Fathers as farre as they could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and by the new more certainely by the euent; I thought good to ſet it together with ſhort concluſions, preſt to that end, wherein the Pope with all his rabble may diſcerne himſelfe. For the order of nature did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that he ſhould euict the Pope to be Antichriſt, which appeareth by the Glaſſe, who had a purpoſe to proue poperie to be Antichriſtianity, which is taught in the Creede. I thought good to ſet before them both, the Glaſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a ſhort compendium of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, fetcht out of the Goſpell, and expreſſed in my Epiſtle to the Chriſtian <hi>Reader.</hi> For you know that two duties belong to the Miniſter, one that hee preach Chriſt ſincerely: the other that he plainely lay open An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, as that worthy man and Martyr of God <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> thought in his time.</p>
            <p>Now all this (I know not how little or nothing) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and brethren, I ſubmit to your iudgement, and commit to your patronage. For thoſe reaſons which ſeemed equall to me to take in hand the defenſe of the buſines, ſhould ſeem ſo to you for the defenſe of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I, when I read that there was mention made of the popiſh creede by our men, but ſaw that it was laid open by none to my knowledge of ſet purpoſe with any of their diſcourſes, I tooke the matter in hand not ſo much in hope to performe that I ſhould doe, as for deſire to trie what I could doe, hoping thereby to ſtirre vp other
<pb facs="tcp:15182:5"/> mens cares who can deale in the buſines more learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eloquently. You haue hitherto heard why I vndertooke this labor: now if it pleaſe you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, why I dedicated it to you. For when I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the whole body of Religion was to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by me in this Creed, I thought good moſt humbly to call together the Religious Clergie to bee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of this worke, of whom the Romiſh Clergie haue taken ſo many deadly blowes, that they feare no Clergies forces and blowes more; and whom it greeueth them to ſee endowed of God with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent parts of pietie, knowledge, tongues and propheſie. Therefore that great Tiberine fiſherman, when as his trade of fiſhing began to be laid aſide, and waxe cold, becauſe that certaine great fiſhes had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his netts torne and worne for age, drew vnto him certaine skilfull workemen out of our Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, with deceitfull rewards, who might mend againe the netts being ſo tatterd and torne, and make them fit to catch not Soules but Crownes; and thoſe whom he first caught with his golden baite as fiſhes, he ſent backe againe as fiſhermen. Whereto agreeth that of Martiall.</p>
            <q>
               <l>He ſent vs great rewards,</l>
               <l>but ſent them on a hooke:</l>

            <p>With the ſame cunning deceipt he doth daily ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to entangle young learned ſtudents, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them with deadly gifts vnto him, that they may helpe, and vphold his forlorne and deſperate quarrell.

               <note place="margin">Which is the Popes ſignet.</note> but chiefly out of England, vnder the ring of the fiſherman, who ſhould ſecretly returne to the fiſh ponds whence they came, and being caught themſelues ſhould catch others, and ſhould bring their boates, and fiſhes of all ſorts, to him, that by that meanes he might make the marchandiſe of his Church the more ſalable. This is the Biſhops cunning. Was this the reaſon he allured our youth vnto him with rewards, and placed them in his Colleges of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> that he ſhould ſend them backe twiſe worſe than hee found them? This couſenage of our young men, wherewith this grand couſoner of the world doth vphold his ſeat, is to be preuented with all the aduiſe we can.

Hee hath none of his ſide more learned than the Engliſh-Prieſts, chiefely the Ieſuites, who that they might infect the Engliſh, write in Engliſh, in the iudgement of wiſemen ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, in the iudgement of fooles probably, that they may ſupply that by the goodnes of their ſtyle, which is wanting to the goodnes of their cauſe.

<pb facs="tcp:15182:7"/> following after, as witneſſes of their owne times, as thoſe that iudge the Apoſtles in a matter of faith are to hee harkened vnto without the Fathers, and not the Fathers without the Apoſtles. So they doe not play with reedes in their hands like the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but ſtrike thorow with their dartes: neither doe they alleage arguments without teſtimonies, or teſtimonies without argumentes: which they doe not reckon vp for number, but conſider for the weight: neither do they deceitfully vrge parcells taken out of the body of the Scripture, as the Aduerſaries, who read them reported out of ſome magiſtrall booke or other; but alleage them being furniſhed with all circumſtances, that from thence they may inferre and vrge the truth: neither doe they follow after types and allegories, but ſearch out the inward ſubſtances and natures of things, neither doe the vſe any whoriſh trimmings, but ſuch ſound and ſober ornaments, which become the cauſe of God. Fearefull opponents, great Orators, ſuch as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are to be eſteemed who doe not write, whoſe ſtinges if any ſhall thinke are loſt becauſe they lye cloſe, he is much deceiued. By hearing of whoſe learned Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Sermons, and reading their bookes I ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſe, I come better inſtructed and prepared to defend the cauſe. That as we read the familie of the <hi>Scipios</hi> were borne to the ruine and ouerthrow of Carthage, ſo me thinke I may hope, that our Clergie is borne againe of God and ſent into the world to the vtter ruin: and deſtruction of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whom therefore may I better deſire to be the Patrone of my labors, then that Clergie that is the fatall vanquiſher of <hi>Rome?</hi> I may adde thereto, that ſeeing my ſelfe in the former courſe
<pb facs="tcp:15182:7"/> of my life haue beene ioyned with many notable men in the Vniuerſitie, either in the fellowſhippe of ſtudies, or in the Court in the dutie of preaching, or in conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the bond of friendſhip: I thought by this my duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Dedication I ſhould renew the memorie of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in Chriſt. Laſt of all, who is ignorant that our writers, when once they haue ſtirred vp more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the God of this world, and haue touched Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to the quicke, with what virulent calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the profeſſed enemies will traduce them? And it is not to be wondered at, if they ſpare not their bookes whoſe throates they would cut: and detract from their good names, whoſe liues they ſeeke after? who when they cannot doe miſchiefe to good men by themſelues, will attempt to effect it by falſe brethren. If this were done in the greene tree, how much more in the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and if they deale thus with the tale Cedars, how will they preſſe downe the meane trees, and lower ſhrubbs? The greater is my hope, that it will come to paſſe that they who write, being moued with the ſenſe of their iniurie: and they that do not write being mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the goodnes of the cauſe, will by their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie maintaine another, that offers himſelfe to danger for the glory of Chriſt. For the Doctors and writers in the cauſe of the Goſpell as they be moſt odious to ſuch as bee wicked ſo ſhould they be moſt deare to them that be well giuen. For theſe cauſes (Fathers and Brethren) I haue thought good to haue theſe my ſmall labours to be moſt humbly and dutifully dedicated vnto you, in whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I thought faithfulneſſe; in whoſe doctrine aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; in whoſe loue comfort; and in whoſe authority helpe did conſiſt. You haue ſeene as I ſaid at the firſt the

But ſhee takes nothing more greeuouſly then that in the ſupremacie of her iuriſdiction, .i. in the chiefe article of her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion, that two of their chiefeſt founders, as ſhee calls them, be ſo ſilent witneſſes in this cauſe <hi>S.

Paul</hi> who when of purpoſe he ſent an Epiſtle to the Romanes, made no mention at all of the Pope and the prerogatiue of the Church of Rome, nor of the after-borne articles of the faith, which ſhee in great plenty brought in afterward. And when as of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had reaſoned of the perpetuall gouernment of the militant Church, and had gathered together many vnities; one God, one faith, one ſpirit, one body, one Lord, hee ouer-paſt one viſible head,<note place="margin">Epheſ: 4.</note> being forgetfull of their <hi>Peter.</hi> And no maruell, when as <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was forgetfull of himſelfe.

But the Nicene Councell doth greatly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Romane Biſhop, whom he maketh but equall to the Biſhop of Alexandria.

Here comes to my minde a certaine tale, not vnpleaſant, of the ſpawne of a frog, which a Calfe had troden vpon in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Damme, which Calfe when one eſcaping from the reſt, had deſcribed to the frogge his damme to bee a great beaſt; how bigge I pray ſaid ſhee, and (puffing out hir ſelfe) thus bigge? greater by the half ſaid the young one:<note place="margin">Horaec.

               </note> what by ſo much, ſaid the Frog, when ſhee had blowne vp hir-ſelfe more and more? not if you breake your ſelfe, ſaid he, can you be equall to it.</p>
            <p>The Councell of Conſtance with her foote trode vpon two frogs, though they would haue fled from tryall, and declared it ſelfe to be greater and higher than
<pb facs="tcp:15182:11"/> the <hi>Pope</hi> though he ſweld neuer ſo bigge. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had done well, if it had not cruſht in peeces two Doues; and had not decreed that cuppe which Chriſt for diuers cauſes had commanded in his ſupper ſhould bee giuen to the people, for moe and more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cauſes, as they ſay, was to bee taken from them. Which the Councell of Baſill did reſtore afterward,<note place="margin">

               </note> and adiudged him an heretike that did obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt the two former truths.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the <hi>Pope</hi> either ſubmit himſelfe vnder the generall Councell, or by the iudgement of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell he muſt needs confeſſe himſelfe to be an heretike. Hence is all their griefe, and their ſecret quarrell againſt the Scriptures, and the former Synods, and the latter alſo, (though they ſomwhat fauoured the Romiſh ſuperſtition) becauſe they did repreſſe her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Till at the laſt two other Councells, the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane and the Tridentine, did lift vp the <hi>Pope,</hi> not onely aboue all Councells, but aboue all Scriptures, that hee at his pleaſure might <hi>put out the Crowes eyes,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is, and as if hee were the 13 Apoſtle, ſet forth a doctrine at his owne liking contrary to the Scripture. After this ſort after many ages, and dangers, the <hi>Pope</hi> got place aboue Biſhops, Kings, Councels, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues.</p>
            <p>So great a worke it was to build the Romiſh ſeate.</p>
            <p>The very naked name whereof is oppoſed againſt all our encounters, as it were <hi>Gorgons head.</hi> Do we alledge the Fathers? what maruell is it, if when he perceiueth they ſtand againſt him, hee reiects them in ſeuerall, when hee contemnes them all in generall?

<pb facs="tcp:15182:12"/> Councels? The former are corrected by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the better by the worſe, and the more by the fewer. Do we alledge the Scriptures? what good do we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, when we haue a <hi>Sphinx</hi> at home, who can lay open the Scripture as it were a riddle according to his owne ſenſe and his beſt auaile. Thus they reduce all things at the laſt to the mother the Church, or rather to the father of the Church. For they make the mother to be of the maſculine gender, and bring the moſt generall generall, to one that is ſingular, that is, to the <hi>Pope</hi> for the time ruling. With whoſe ſpirit that Synagogue being filled, it ſeemeth cloſely to be offended with none of the Apoſtles more than with <hi>S. Paul:</hi> by whoſe ſilence, ſhee taks her ſelfe not only not to be aſſiſted, but to be hurt by his teſtimonie, when as the merit of workes being abandoned, hee concludeth the onely mercy of God in Chriſt being apprehended by faith, to be mans iuſtice before God. Which concluſion doth ouerthrow all Poperie, as it ſhall afterward appeare. It doth plague the Synagogue: for it toucheth two things to the quicke, the Biſhops miter, and the Monkes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: for faith being placed in the only merits of Chriſt, hath diminiſhed the Indulgences, the treaſure of the Church, and makes the offrings to images to be more rare and ſparing. So that the Synagogue, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as well cloſely accuſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> of hereſie, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin.</hi> I once heard two old popiſh Doctors, one of them a Fryer <hi>Ieronimite in Portugall,</hi> another a <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in France</hi> ſay, when they were preſt with <hi>Pauls</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, one of them <hi>that S. Peter without doubt was a Catholike, but Paul if he be not warily expounded ſeemes to ſmell of hereſie.</hi> Thother, <hi>that places out of Paul, by the teſtimonie of Peter, were hard to be vnderſtood, and had need of a Romiſh Commentarie;</hi> Peter I ſaid made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hardnes, but not of the commentarie. In whoſe Epiſtle ſay they, <hi>whatſoeuer ſoundeth againſt the Romane faith therein wee do not attaine to the true ſenſe,
<pb facs="tcp:15182:12"/> that which the Rhemists haue obſerued.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rhem: teſtam argument: epiſt: in gene.</note> For he in the firſt chapter (ſay the Fryers) <hi>did commend the faith of the Church of Rome, whereto Cyprian denieth that vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes can haue acceſſe.</hi> But in the 11. chapter, I ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt:</hi> 50.</note> he warned the ſame Church, that if it departed from the bountifulneſſe of God, it ſhould take heed leſt as the Church of Iſrael was cut off, ſo ſhee were not cut off alſo. It may therefore be cut off be it ſpoken by <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> leaue. For it is in act cut off, when it is fallen from that foundation, which is placed in the only mercy of Chriſt, apprehended by faith. That faith therefore of the Church which <hi>Paul the Apoſtle</hi> ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and taught by his writings is one: and the faith of this Church which <hi>Paul the Pope</hi> hath left ſo defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his vnwritten traditions is another. And yet ſhee glorieth much, as I ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> is hir founder; I had rather they would vſe him as an author. But ſhe will neuer doe it. Shee maketh more accompt of <hi>Pauls Bulls,</hi> than <hi>Paules Epiſtles:</hi> which the ancient Fathers did rightly tearme the key of the Scripture. Which moſt of the popiſh ſort do ſo feare, that they cannot reconcile <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>S.

               </note> as if <hi>Iames the Apoſtle had concluded that a man is iuſtified by his workes before God, not with faith alone, againſt the Apoſtle Paul;</hi> when as <hi>Paul</hi> doth not vnderſtand the ſame faith and the ſame iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Iames</hi> doth. For hee requireth faith placed in the heart: this reiecteth faith bragged on in the tongue. Hee requireth a liuely faith, this reiecteth a dead faith. Hee doth enforce a heauenly faith, which layeth hold on the promiſe: this caſteth of a diueliſh faith, which doth onely acknowledge Chriſts hiſtorie without application: hee doth commend and extoll fruitfull faith working by loue: this doth rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a barraine faith voide of the duty of holineſſe: he doth ſet forth the iuſtification before God, which <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth the righteouſnes of imputation, <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15182:13"/> the iuſtification before men, whom the ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth the righteouſneſſe of declaration. <hi>Moſes,</hi> from whom either Apoſtle drew his teſtimonie, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ech, and doth take vp the controuerſie, begun by the Aduerſarie. The imputation of righteouſneſſe, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh mention Gen: 15.6. went thirty yeares before that worke, for which they dreame that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified before God. Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time <hi>Paul</hi> moſt earneſtly weighing, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that faith was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> to obtaine righteouſneſſe before God 15 yeares, as <hi>Moſes</hi> noteth, before hee begat <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and other 15 yeares at the leaſt before he would haue ſacrificed him.</p>
            <p>They know not well how to looſe themſelues out of this indiſſoluble knot, whoſoeuer thinke that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> before God, becauſe he killed his ſonne who was not as yet borne, when as the Holy Ghoſt doth pronounce him to be righteous: which <hi>S. Iames</hi> himſelfe v: 23 ſeemeth to vnderſtand, as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> gathereth out of the place. that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the image of iuſtification, which is wrought by faith alone, when it was imputed to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">ver: 23. ver: 21.</note> that he beleeued: and of that iuſtification alſo which is by workes, when hee would haue offred his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> vpon the Altar. Therefore faith did make perfect the perſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the worke did iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the faith, and declare ech to be perfect. Is this a fight? is this an oppoſition? eſpecially betweene two holy Apoſtles, who writ their Epiſtles with the inſtinct of the ſame ſpirit. But no one thing doth more neerly gaule the Synagogue, then that <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle by the direction of the ſpirit, writ the commentarie of the myſterie,<note place="margin">Apoc: 9. 2 Theſſ: 2. 1 Tim: 4.1.</note> which <hi>S.

Iohn calls him <hi>the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit, the key-keeper of hell, the beaſt ariſing

This is the nature, this is the diſpoſition of the Apoſtles doctrine: it doth depreſſe man, that it may extoll God: it doth caſt off corrupt nature, that it may bring in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace. A man therefore muſt liue in God, yea farther by God, before he can either will, or thinke any good; a meere paſſiue ſubiect of grace at the firſt, while being as it were made warme by the ſpirit of Chriſt, hee beginneth to will his owne conuerſion, and is made a voluntarie inſtrument of grace, by no imbred or infuſed force of the will, but by the
<pb facs="tcp:15182:15"/> power of the ſeede of grace, and of the new life which hee had from God. Paul doth thus diſtinguiſh betweene a man to be converted, and converted. He maketh him to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſeruant of ſinne, becauſe he is ouercome of ſinne; this free in part, becauſe he is made free by the Sonne: not appointing him free in part, leſt he make him ſacrilegious, nor this altogether a ſeruant, leſt he might make him ſluggiſh. He doth not therefore take from the vnregenerate, all power of willing, but all power of well-willing, that he may not lift vp the creſt of his naturall pride; and he granteth to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſome power of well-willing, that he may not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſtrength of ſpirituall diligence.

               </q> 
               <hi>But that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the motions of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, whereto the will doth not conſent, this of the beaſtly affections, whereto the will is wholy addicted. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by the working of the naturall conſcience, hee ſaith he hateth. But aſſoone as a man begins to liue in God, ſinne begins to dye in man. For it hath receiued a deadly wound in the roote in reſpect of guiltineſſe: while it be cured by perfect buriall it remaines dead, not cut off, that we may be humbled; not imputed, leſt we ſhould be caſt downe. Sin dwelleth in vs as a Iebuſite ſubdued, not expelled; ſubdued, it taketh feare from vs; not expelled, it ſhakes off ſecuritie, that to ſtriue with it, it is farre more ſafe, than to haue no enemie at all. In this fight Gods grace doth helpe vs, ſtrengthning vs with a double ſacrament: of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: there the fountaine of regeneration is
<pb facs="tcp:15182:16"/> powred out, here the bread of life is ſet before vs: there is a healthfull bathe to waſh vs when we are fowle, here is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall feaſt to feede vs when we were faint: ſo that from each we may take ſtrength to reſist. So the power of God is made perfect in our infirmitie, which when out of our owne skarres it ſtirreth vp in vs a courage to fight, ſo from helpe miniſtred from thence it puts into vs ſure hope that we ſhall ouercome. For it bringeth griefe out of the fall for ſinne, and ſtirreth vp ſtrife out of griefe with ſinne, and out of ſtrife bringeth the victorie of ſinne: So out of poyſon it gets a remedy, and out of the ſickneſſe it getteth health. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it in the meane while depriue vs of inward comfort, while wee waite for the eternall tryumph: But in the fight it ſhewes vs the propitiation; after the fight, which endeth in death, it preſently openeth the holy place of holyest, ſo that neither peace of conſcience is wanting to them being aliue, and their ſoules ſhall haue reſt when they are dead. Thus it commeth to paſſe, that theſe broken relikes of ſinne in the ſonnes of God, by Gods grace do much profit, when out of them they make an antidote againſt pride, neither are puft vp with the merits of their owne works. Wherby the doctrine of Trent ought to be accounted the more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which doth decree</hi> that eternall life is to be reſtored to the faithfull, for the merit of workes, <hi>which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle propoundeth not as the reward of a ſeruant, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of a ſonne; not payed for ſpirituall obedience, but giuen to the ſpirituall generation, as</hi> Auſtin <hi>expounds the Apoſtle: the crowne of righteouſneſſe in reſpect of Christ, who merited: a crowne of mercy, in reſpect of vs for whom he merited, to be giuen by the iuſt iudge, not for the weight of mans merit, but for the force of Gods promiſe: to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> according to their workes, not for their workes,<note place="margin">Gregor: in <hi>7.</hi> Pſal: peniten.</note> 
               <hi>as Pope Gregorie diſtinguiſheth out of the Apoſtle. The ſtudie therefore of good workes is to be vrged, becauſe God ſhall iudge</hi> according to thy works: <hi>but merit is to be detested, becauſe it ſhall neuer ſaue thee</hi> for good works. <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you do well is of God, not of the merit of man, but of
<pb facs="tcp:15182:17"/> the bleſſing of God. You doe owe it therefore to God, as the creature to the Creator, as a captiue ſeruant to his redeemer: acknowledge thy ſelfe a ſeruant, who of right doſt owe dutie vnto thy Lord: and whereas God doth call thee his ſonne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge grace, and forget not nature. Neither thinke thou haſt deſerued any thing, if thou haue done well, becauſe thou oughtſt to haue done ſo. Beſides remember, that there is ſome filthines from the fleſh mingled with thy worke though good, which doth purely flow from the ſpirit, that that very thing, that we ſeeme to liue iuſtly, is a fault, if our work, when Gods ſeueritie iudgeth it, Gods mercie doe not excuſe it before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo that the fault in the worke muſt firſt be forgiuen to the penitent, by grace, before the worke it ſelfe bee crowned by promiſe. Laſtly the Apoſtle ſaith that</hi> the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, that if a man ſhould ſerue God a thouſand yeares, and that moſt zealouſly, he ſhould not deſerue for the merit to be halfe a day in heauen,<note place="margin">Anſelm. de menſura crucis.</note> 
               <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaid, <hi>although we die a thouſand times, although wee performe all the virtues of the minde, yet wee can doe nothing worthy of earthly bleſſinges, and ſuch as are preſent, which we daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from God, much leſſe heauenly and future which wee looke for as</hi> Ierome,<note place="margin">Jerom. in hunc loc.</note> Chryſoſtome, and Baſill <hi>haue taught.

And if the free loue of God, whereby he being moued did bring thee backe from death to life, and forgaue thee all thy tranſgreſſions, and healed all thy infirmities, and hath crowned thee with his mercies, (marke what the Prophet ſaith) not with thy merites, but with his mercies: if this free loue I ſay ſhall not drawe from thee free obedience, nothing ſhall euer draw it from thee.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>There be many forceable arguments whereby the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:15182:17"/> perſwadeth vs to liue holily, ſoberly, and iuſtly, that with good workes we ſet forth Gods glory, which workes though they appeaſe not God, yet they pleaſe God, and make our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vocation thereby ſure vnto vs. But there is nothing more powerfull then the fatherly loue of God, to prouoke to goodneſſe the ingenuous mindes of ſonnes.</hi> This is the will of God euen the ſanctification and ſaluation of vs all: <hi>to the which endes he choſe vs from eternitie, hee called and iuſtified vs in time, and he ſhall glorifie vs to eternitie. So the mercie of</hi> Iehouah <hi>toward his ſonnes is from eternitie to eternitie, for whom he hath preordained ſaluation in choſing them, declared it in calling them, begun it in iuſtifying them, and ſhall perfect it in glorifying them. They that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the ſpirit of God doe certainely know that they bee in the grace of God now preſent, and ſhall be euer hereafter, entring into the ſtate of grace by faith, and ſtanding therein by faith, and glorying vnder the hope of the glorie of God, by faith, as the Apoſtle teacheth: which place</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>doth thus expound,</hi> that hee that hath giuen his faith to God, that there ought not onely a full perſwaſion to be aſſured them of thoſe things which are giuen preſently, but of thoſe that are to come, as if they were now giuen. <hi>That the ſtate of regeneration ſhould be thought to bee more certaine, then of creation. The ſtate of the firſt Adam was changeable, of the ſecond vnchangeable, whoſe true and liuely members all the ſonnes of God are to be eſteemed. Wherefore of the ſtate of Chriſt be vnchangeable, the ſtate of them that are truely Chriſtians, who being grafted into Chriſt by faith do liue, and ſhall liue by their faith (as the Apoſtle noteth out of the Prophet) muſt needes be vnchangeable. For it was granted to</hi> Adam, <hi>that hee was able not to die, as</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſpeaketh, but to a Chriſtian that he cannot poſſibly die. Three things ſaith</hi> Bernard <hi>I conſider, wherein all my hope doth conſiſt:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The loue of adoption.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The truth of the promiſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>And the power of the reward.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:15182:18"/>
            <p>Which do ſo ſtrengthen and confirme my heart, that no want of merites, no conſideration of our profit, no accompt of the heauenly bleſſing can driue mee from the depth of that hope wherein I am ſurely grounded. Therefore let my fooliſh thought murmure all it can, ſaying who art thou? or how great is that glory, or by what merites doſt thou hope to obtaine it? And I will confidently anſwere, I know whom I haue truſted, I am in great aſſurance, becauſe my God in great loue hath adopted me, becauſe he is true in his promiſe, and able to performe it. Thus <hi>Bernard</hi> out of the Apoſtle: <hi>Who makes it plaine that the ſtate of regeneration is moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly confirmed to euery ſonne of God, not onely by Gods promiſe, but by Gods Oath. Whom hee maketh partaker of the right faith, and of working loue, and of liuely hope, and of earneſt repentance, and of new obedience, and calleth him the heire of the promiſe. To whom God as being willing to make the immutable certainety of his counſell knowne plentifully, as to</hi> Abraham <hi>the Father, ſo to</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſonne, did not onely promiſe, but ſweare that hee would performe that to him which he had promiſed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> 
               <hi>For in God it is all one to ſweare and to ſay. Yet that we ſhould haue ſtrong conſolation, who follow after to obtaine the hope ſet before vs, which hee hath appointed as a ſure and ſtrong anker, entred within the veile,</hi> i. <hi>heauen, whither Christ the forerunner is entred before vs, he hath confirmed our immutable ſtate vnto vs by two immutable things his promiſe and his Oath. Let the prayer of Chriſt be ioyned to the oath of God, wherein hee praieth to God the father, that he would imbrace vs with the ſame loue, that he embraced Christ himſelfe,</hi> i. <hi>with eternall loue: and would crowne vs with the ſame glorie, as hee crowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and did not onely pray for vs, but died alſo, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and was receiued into heauen, that hee ſhould for euer make interceſſion for vs. Who hath left vnto vs his holy ſpirit, whereby he hath ſealed vnto vs the heauenly inheritance. And therefore God hath aſſured eternall ſaluation to his ſons, not onely by promiſe, but by Oath, but by prayer, and
<pb facs="tcp:15182:18"/> ſacrifice of Chriſt, and by the ſeale of the holy Ghost, that wee ſhould not doubt thereof. And yet that wicked Councell of Trent decreed,</hi> that none could know by the certainetie of infallible faith that hee is in the ſtate of Grace, much leſſe ſhall bee, but that euerie one ſhould bee in doubt and feare of his owne Grace. <hi>That it ſeemeth to haue vtterly ouerthrowne all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of mans ſaluation laid by the Apoſtle, as it ſhall plainly appeare by the diſcourſe vpon the popiſh Creede.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie Marinarius <hi>did withſtand that wicked decree euen in the Councell it ſelfe,</hi> who taught the perſeuerance of the faithfull was ſecure, and their ſecuritie to be perſeuered in. Ambroſe Catharinus <hi>did likewiſe reſist, who maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> that a ſonne of God by the certaintie of faith doth know that he is in the ſtate of grace, as any man may be ſure that there is Rome, yea and that without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or feare, ſo that he openly did reſiſt the Councell. Albertus Pighius <hi>did afterward oppoſe himſelfe, who of ſet purpoſe doth defend</hi> that our righteouſneſſe is imputed to vs by faith alone vnto life. <hi>The</hi> Councell of Colen <hi>may thee ioyned to theſe, wherein many learned Diuines</hi> True it is, <hi>ſay they,</hi> and it is required to the iuſtification of a man, that he certainely beleeue, not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that they who do truly repent ſhall obtaine mercy by Chriſt, but that the man that beleeueth ſhall obtaine forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes by faith in Chriſt: <hi>which they learned out of the Apoſtle by the interpretation of</hi> Bernard. <hi>Thou haſt Gentle Reader the Glaſſe of Chriſt, the ſumme of the Apoſtolike doctrine, to be ſet before the doctrine of the Trent Councell, who doth ſtrike vs with a curſe for the ſame, more fully hereafter to be propounded and maintayned. The power whereof is ſuch, that it doth clip the winge of humane pride, that it doth aduance the glory of Gods grace, that it doth ſtirre vp an earneſt deſire of godlines, and doth faſten a ſure anchor of ſaluation: that the ſonnes of God may be made lowly in ſinne, thankefull in bleſſing, holy in life, and cheerefull in death.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:15182:19"/>
            <p>This doctrine Trent Councell doth ouerthrow, from whence thoſe twelue articles of faith proceeded, which <hi>Pius the</hi> 4. brought into the forme of a Creede, enioyned to be publikely profeſſed of his, by his Bull vnder an oath: which though they had their birth and beginning from heretikes, yet they carry the name of the true faith, and counterfeit the Apoſtles to be their parents, that the greater ſtore of Chriſtians may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to receiue them. As wee heretofore haue heard that <hi>Lambert</hi> counterfeting the name and kindred of the Earle of Warwicke, had many followers, when in truth he was the baſtard of a villanous Prieſt: So if any ſhall compare theſe twelue baſtardly and falſe articles of the Popes creede, with the true and right articles of the Apoſtles creede, hee ſhall finde them to be as like the Apoſtles, as the baſtard of <hi>Simon</hi> the Prieſt, was like the ſoone of the Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> The ſchoolemen and the Canoniſts haue had great adoe between them, whether the Pope could make any new articles of the faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as a worſhipfull moderator takes vp the matter in <hi>Tortus. He diuides the articles into two ſorts. He writes that ſome are of immediat reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, others drawn &amp; fetch from them, which notwithſtanding are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a catholike beleefe.</hi> How fooliſhly I ſhall ſhew hereafter, now only I ſhew what they hold. Articles of the firſt ſort <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth may be made of the Pope. As much as if he ſhould deny the ſunne could be made by the Pope, ſo many ages faſtned to his globe by the hand of God. The articles of the ſecond ſtampe hee doth plainly affirme may be made by the Pope; as if he ſhould ſay, that he profeſſeth himſelfe to be the author and maker of that booke, whereof he is the expounder and interpreter.</p>
            <p>Now the Ieſuites haue diuided thoſe that were drawne from the firſt into two other kindes, which are ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly coucht together that they can hardly be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Some of them conſiſt in practiſe, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:15182:19"/> treaſon is nouriſhed, other conſiſt in doctrine, wherby ſuperſtition is cheriſhed. Thoſe they ſcatter myſtically and cloſely, theſe plainly and openly. Thoſe I call pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall and myſticall, which concerne the Popes power in depoſing of Kings by the ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and abſoluing ſubiects from the oath of fealtie: and conſpiracies and rebellions to be concealed vnder the ſeale of confeſſion; and Clerkes to bee exempted from the iudgement of a ſecular Prince; and the power of the Pope aboue the Councell, and other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked concluſions of the ſame kinde, with the <hi>ſchoole of Paris</hi> hath lately condemned. And a certaine Prieſt termed a more moderate anſwerer, that hee may more couertly and freely teach the profeſſed articles of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, doth ouerthrow thoſe myſticall articles of rebellion: for which cauſe he complayneth that their ſalary is denyed him, and the Prieſts of his order by the Pope. Whom I thinke good hee ſhould anſwer, as the Aſſe anſwered Balaam, <hi>Am not I thine Aſſe, whereon thou wert wont to ride euen till this day? Tell me if euer I did the like before, and now I haue once offended in telling the truth, why wilt thou beate mee, and take my prouender from me?</hi> If ſuch Prieſts will giue eare to me, let them forſake ſo vnthankfull, and vniuſt a maſter, and come ouer to our ſide. For I feare leſt while they ſecretly ſow their open articles of ſuperſtition among our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they will draw them from the faith of Chriſt, and beget ſchollers for Ieſuites, whom they will infect with their hidden articles of rebellion, and bring them from their allegeance and obedience to the King. Theſe are fetcht from the firſt, baſtards borne of baſtards, vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pers bred of vipers, the laſt more wicked than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſhortly bringing forth an of ſpring more vilanous. Thoſe that are fetcht from immediate revelations, as they bee ſuppoſed, make truth the way for hereſie, as the authors thereof pretend iuſtice for wickedneſſe. But this is the diſpoſition of all heretikes, that out of
<pb facs="tcp:15182:20"/> a generall truth propounded, they alway aſſume and draw out hereſie, which as a witch doth caſt in a ſacred furie into their deceiued mindes. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> from the generall allegation of Gods grace and helpe, do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſpeciall rule of their hereſie, which as poyſon they diſtill more eaſily into the mindes of their ſimple Auditors. The Papiſts holding thoſe articles of Chriſt generally, do infuſe hereticall poyſon deepe into their mindes being ſeaſoned with the ſweet of thoſe generals. I will giue you one example, which doth farther ſpread it ſelfe. They beleeue in generall that Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp into heauen, and ſits at the right hand of God, and ſhall come from thence to iudge both the quicke and the dead. Yet the Prieſt doth daily bring Chriſt from thence, to wit, out of heauen into the ſacrament, ſo that he is corporally preſent in the ſacrament, when it is manifeſt that hee is conteyned in heauen till all things be fulfilled. But here they diſtinguiſh, <hi>that Chriſt ſhall come once from heauen viſibly to iudgement, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth inviſibly euery day into the ſacrament.</hi> O notable deduction, that ouerturneth the principle from whence it is drawne! O notable diſtinction, which doth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing vtterly ouerthrow the principall article But ſo doth hereſie beſmere ouer the lip of the cuppe as it were with honie, that it may be taken and goe downe the more merily. As <hi>Pius the</hi> 4, who brought in the Conſtantinople creed, which he calleth the Rom: creed, as a preface before the new creede being their owne. Which when it ſeem'd to me to be vnworthily done, I thought good to diſcourſe of this new Creede of the faith, compoſed by the Pope in a wicked intent, being the ſumme of Antichriſtianitie, in a Latin Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, diuided into three bookes. The firſt Dialogue bringeth in Antichriſt as an Actor on the ſtage: the ſecond and third as a Doctor in the chayre. The firſt doth fully deſcribe the practiſe of the Beaſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is termed <hi>Pragmaticall Antichriſt,</hi> or <hi>Hildebrand

But becauſe hee hath made a ſcepter of his Croſiers ſtaffe, the ſecond Dialogue is rightly termed <hi>The ruling Paſtor.</hi> I follow after as I can but not with equall paces, certaine notable Fathers of our Church, who when as they firſt refute the graue (as they ſeeme) and probable opinions of Antichriſt earneſtly and ſoundly: doe afterward pleaſantly and wittily laugh at his fooliſh and harmefull Inſtitutions. <hi>Truth doth ſomtime laugh at hereſie, becauſe ſhee is ſafe and ſecure,</hi> as Tertullian ſaith.

There is almoſt none of our writers, who haue not written that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Antichriſt; But there be certaine men among vs very moderate, forſooth, and politicke, who would not haue the Aduerſarie ſo angered and ſtirred vp with ſo ſharpe a concluſion, and that thereby all hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and peace betweene the parties ſhould bee cut off: betweene whom they thinke to bee a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wordes, but little or none at all of things: that God is alike deare to each Church, and that the litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of each is alike accepted of God, that ſaluation is in both, when each doth reſt vpon Chriſt the foundation, that a Papiſt may, although halting come to heauen, and that the hatred of Papiſts is not ſo great as we make it, and that it is not conceiued by their owne accord, but that it is encenſed by ſuch bitter diſputations: and that the quarrell had been ended, if certaine hot ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Theologians had not encreaſed the controuerſie. Theſe luke-warme Chriſtians, that ſeeme to bee of no ſide and of both ſides, ſeeme to diſpute ſoberly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly.
<pb facs="tcp:15182:22"/> But your religious wiſedome, Chriſtian <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> doth better vnderſtand, that the Romane Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue is full of idolatrie, and that it doth therefore hate God, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> iudgement, is againe hatefull to God: neither was <hi>Caine</hi> prouoked with any iniurie of <hi>Abels,</hi> but by his owne malice and hatred of godlines: And though both of them were wont to ſacrifice to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Adames</hi> houſe, yet <hi>Caines</hi> ſacrifice was reiected, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> accepted, and the worke pleaſed God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not the perſon for the worke; that which <hi>Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> gathereth out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the perſon was firſt made righteous by faith, as the Apoſtle taught <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and that therefore there is no leſſe difference of worſhip and faith betweene a Proteſtant and a Papiſt, then was betweene <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi> And that the Synagogues anger againſt our Church is as implacable, as <hi>Caines</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Iſmaels</hi> againſt <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that before it was ſtirred vp with the blaſt of contention, it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with hatred of the promiſe. And as the hatred of <hi>Iſmael</hi> againſt the promiſe, which he derided, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a viſard of circumciſion, brake out againſt the ſonne of the promiſe; ſo the hidden and ſecret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Synagogue of Rome againſt the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the tables of the promiſe, as I ſaid, being couered with a certaine ſhew of voluntarie religion, did greiuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake and burne out againſt our Church the heire of the promiſe, ſo that <hi>Agar</hi> doth not leaue off to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute <hi>Sara</hi> againe, the Haidmayde her Miſtris in the houſe of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And when it can bee proued that <hi>Caines</hi> ſacrifice was as well accepted of God as <hi>Abels,</hi> then I will grant that the Papiſts Maſſe be as acceptable to God, as the Liturgie of the Proteſtants; and when it can be euicted that Chriſt alone apprehended by faith without our workes, is not the foundation of the <hi>church</hi> I wil grant that the ſame is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of both Churches. Laſtly, when it ſhall appeare that <hi>Iſmael</hi> the ſonne of the handmaide borne by the power of nature,
<pb facs="tcp:15182:23"/> is coheyre of the houſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſonne of the free woman borne by the force of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, then I will grant that an obſtinate Papiſt, may come halting to heauen. In the meane time I will warne theſe luke-warme and halting Proteſtant, that they will giue ſentence in Gods matters according to the certaine truth of God, not out of their prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting charitie, and that there be no middle counſell to be taken: neither let them truſt, the Pope being more ioyntly and eaſily intreated by them, will be the more eaſie and gentle to them. Whom we by ſhort conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions out of holy <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> excellently expounded by notable worthies of our Church, although a little more bitterly and roughly, then ſeemeth good to ſome, we ſhew to be Antichriſt. I confeſſe that this is a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and darke prophecie, whoſe importance doth reiect the vanitie of tales, whoſe obſcuritie requireth more cleare light of interpretation. So it falleth out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that the expoſition is larger, the concluſion ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For a ſhort expoſition and a long concluſion are faultie alike when hard and controuerſies of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are handled. For a ſhort expoſition wants light, and a long concluſion wants ſharpeneſſe of wit. The Aduerſarie doth offend in both, while hee is buſied in the interpretation of the prophecie, for it doth leſſen things of weight, neither doth it make plaine matters obſcure. For hee doth depreſſe the excellencie of the prophecy by ſtuffing it vp with the vanitie of many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and being ſatisfied with vncertaine coniectures of Fathers, and with their naked names, hath not driuen away the obſcuritie. So it falleth out, that from ſtrange and vnkinde expoſitions of the prophecie, they gather weake and idle concluſions. In the vnfoulding of this myſterie, the holy fathers haue ſtood vs in good ſteed, and more had, if they had beene Prophets. But when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they (<hi>Daniel</hi> being the Authour) doe teach that the vnderſtanding of the propheſie, is to be taken from the
<pb facs="tcp:15182:23"/> performance of it, and grant that <hi>truth is the daughter of time,</hi> we that are fallen vpon the endes of times, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the parts of the prophecie betweene themſelues with great ſtudy and reuerence, and bringing light to the text, out of the context, and to the context out of the euent, becauſe Chriſt hath opened the booke that was ſealed vp, nor called it an<note n="a" place="margin">A thing ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; hidden.</note> 
               <hi>apocrypſe,</hi> but an<note n="b" place="margin">A thing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> 
               <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi> we do from thence more confidently drawe a concluſion, not as an Article of faith, but as aſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the doctrine of Chriſt. Although the popiſh Synagogue, which without any teſtimonie of Scripture makes this the thirteenth Article of their faith, <hi>I beleeue that the Pope is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar of Christ,</hi> may iuſtly pardon the reformed Church if being taught by ſo many teſtimonies of Scripture, it make this to be an Article of their faith, <hi>I beleeue that the Pope is Antichriſt.</hi> Now I did foreſee that when I made a looking glaſſe for <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. it would come to paſſe, that the Ieſuites, who do ſo often traduce the King of <hi>great Britaine,</hi> with their ſlanderous and infamous libels, would bee much mooued to anger, that I often vſed the name of their Pope in this manner. For what will they ſay? dareſt thou an obſcure fellow ſpeake ſo often to the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a Prince? or conceiueſt thou any hope that being an hereticall miniſter, thou canſt conuert ſo great a Doctor? Whereby thou haſt got naught elſe for thy labour, but that thy folly and pride ſhould be knowne to all men. Theſe I preſage will bee the embleames of the Ieſuitiſh ſtile, whereto (thy ſelfe <hi>Reader</hi> ſhalt bee an Arbitrator) I ſhortly anſwere. I ſee that the Pope of his owne is accounted a great Father, but thruſt as a ſmall Prince by his great neighbour Princes into a ſmall corner of the ſouth: but how bigge ſoeuer he be, I ſpeak to the Pope as not to a politicall Prince, but politicall Antichriſt. I fauour his ciuill dignitie whatſoeuer it be, but I ſpare not his ſpirituall impietie. But what? doe I take in hand to conuert the Pope? no more then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb facs="tcp:15182:24"/> to <hi>waſh an Ethiopian.</hi> I am not yet ſo madde. I know <hi>that the belly hath no eares.</hi> And it may be <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, as it is ſaid, is dead. What then? but <hi>Paul</hi> being dead the Pope is aliue. One head groweth vp vnder an other. For the popedome is a <hi>Hydra.</hi> I doe not defend that this or that Pope, but that the Pope is Antichriſt. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now Chriſtian Reader, that I exhort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee by thy ſaluation, that the hatred of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue being contemned, though thou well know Chriſt, to knowe him with mee daily better out of the Scriptures, that both of vs may more earneſtly loue him, and more earneſtly follow him being loued, and further that you know him peraduenture ſuſpected by you, to be Antichriſt, more certainely by the euent of the prophecie, that being known each may purſue him with an holy hatred, and right execration; to which purpoſe I firſt ſet before thee the Glaſſe of Chriſt and view of Chriſtianitie, now I ſet before thee the Popes looking-Glaſſe and the picture of ANTICHRIST.</p>

Whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth terme a beaſt with two hornes, they will make a horned beaſt indeed. The two witneſſes whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth two Oliue trees, and two Candleſtickes, if by the Letter they vrge them to be two men, that is <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who muſt be ſlaine by Antichriſt they will imagine a very terrible Antichriſt that will kill Oliue trees and Candleſtickes: If the two witneſſes ſhall caſt out true fire out of their mouthes, theſe fiery fellowes will ſuddenly conſume Antichriſt.

At a word (<hi>Paul</hi> the fift) they muſt not bring backe the ſunne fifteene degrees, as in the dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but more then a thouſand degrees, that theſe may agree together.

                  </gap>. They grant he is Chriſts oppoſite and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, his Vicar they denie him. <hi>S.

A Vicar or ſubſtitute in apparance, an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in truth; as it is manifeſt by the definition of the thing it ſelfe, and of the word. For what can thoſe two hornes of the Lambe ſignifie other, then the two offices of Chriſt, his prieſtly, and his kingly office? which the Beaſt imagineth that ſhee weareth in ſteed of the lambe, whence I conclude,</p>
               <p>The Beaſt is a counterfeit Vicar of the Lambe by the witneſſe of <hi>Iohn.</hi>

               <p>Antichriſt doth comprehend all theſe ſignifications, who though he be in truth his Aduerſarie, yet doth challenge Chriſt his authoritie, as his equall, and vſurpes his place, as his Vicar.</p>
               <p>The Pope is Chriſt his Vicegerent, doth emulate his honour, and oppoſe his doctrine.</p>

Thus I therefore argue breefely out of the premiſſes.</p>
               <p>If that Antichriſt was in the daies of the Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be reuealed to domineir in the Church, nor to be deſtroyed till the comming of Chriſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he cannot be one ſingular perſon, vnleſſe peraduenture they dreame that Antichriſt ſhall ſuruiue <hi>Methuſalah</hi> many hundred yeeres.</p>

               <p>FOR whereas Antichriſt ſo called in a common ſenſe by <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epiſtle, they ſay did come in the times of the Apoſtles: but that Antichriſt ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called in the Apocalyps is not come as yet; firſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15182:29"/> they doe not agree among themſelues, who vnderſtand that it is Antichriſt ſo properly called of <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epiſtle, by reaſon of the addition of the article: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, although he there make mention of Antichriſts ſo commonly called, ſmall and litle ones, whom conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by themſelues I confeſſe to haue beene the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of that great Antichriſt, yet I ſay and affirme, that they be truly to be termed parts of that great beaſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his Commentarie of this myſterie hath ſo plainly expounded. For he ſaith, that hee who then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to worke ſecretly, ſhould continue till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt. That therefore he could not be a beaſt of three yeeres continuance, ſoone vp &amp; ſoone downe. But as ſmall Riuers while they keepe within their owne bankes haue their own names,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude between An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and a great Riuer.</note> but when they flow into the Thames, or into Seine doe looſe their owne names, and make the ſtreame the greater: So is it with theſe ſmall and common Antichriſts: they falling into their owne hereſies are conſidered apart; but when they fall out of their own channels as it were into that great gulfe Antichriſt,<note place="margin">1 Ioh: 4.3. &amp; 2.18. &amp; 22.</note> they lay aſide their owne names, and make vp that grand Antichriſt. And therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epiſtle ſaith, that that Antichriſt then was, and after ſhould be. How may that be will you ſay? that he was then in ſecret, that he ſhould be in open ſight: that he was then an infant, but ſhould after be a man. Theſe were the hereſies, this was that Apoſtacie wherof <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpake, <hi>a diſpoſition</hi> as Bellarmine confeſſeth, <hi>tending to the kingdome of Antichrist;</hi> he ſaid well to the kingdom, not to his beginning. For then he was borne but to the kingdome of Antichriſt, not to the eſſence of him, that then was as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid, but to the reuealing of him who then lay hid as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid. The apoſtacie therefore began in thoſe hereſies, wherein Antichriſt did lurke, which <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach ſhall laſt not onely to an appearance, and a kingdome, but to the diminiſhing and ouerthrow of Antichriſt. And this apoſtacie could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15182:29"/> not be of three yeares, and one man onely. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is conuinc't that Antichriſt is not one ſingular man, but a ſucceſſion of men. Moreouer the two beaſts deſcribed by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Apocalyps, the Sea-beaſt, and the Land-beaſt; by the Sea-beaſt <hi>you meane the ſtate of the Romane Empire;</hi> by the Land-beaſt <hi>the ſtate of Antichrist.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom: Pont. cap. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; cap. <hi>15.</hi> lib. <hi>3</hi>
                  </note> But the Sea-beaſt doth not ſignifie this or that Emperour, but a ſucceſſion of Emperours: therefore the Land-beaſt doth not ſignifie this or that Biſhop only, but a ſucceſſion of Biſhops, whereof many were great beaſts indeed. As likewiſe neither the foure beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> whereof the beaſt in the Apocalyps is compounded, doe not note ſingular Kings, but King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſputeth againſt vs topically, or rather typically.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Such as the figure is, ſuch is the thing figured.</l>
                  <l>Antiochus the figure of Antichrist was one ſingular man.</l>
                  <l>Therfore Antichriſt the thing figured is one ſingular man.</l>
               </q>
               <p>If the propoſition be generall it is very falſe, for the proportion between the figure, and the thing figured, doth not hold in all, but in thoſe only wherein they be compared. Many are often the type of one, as many high Prieſts of one Chriſt, and one is the type of one, as Melchiſedech of Chriſt, whom you notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doe make to be the type of many Prieſts. It hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not therefore that becauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> the type was one man, that therfore Antichriſt muſt be but one man. The compariſon ſtands not in the vnitie of the perſon, but in the likeneſſe of nature: And therefore if the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition be taken generally, it is very falſe, and if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, then it is a meere fallacie. But if it pleaſe him to argue from a type, I will requite him with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne from a type, the authour whereof is the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>The firſt Beaſt that is the ſtate of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is a Beaſt of many heads.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15182:30"/>
               <p>The ſecond Beaſt that is the ſtate of Antichriſt, is the image of the firſt by the witneſſe of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the ſtate of Antichriſt is a beaſt of many heads.</p>
               <p>But ſo many heads, ſo many perſons. As therefore the ſtate of Antichriſt may reſemble the ſtate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it doth conſiſt not in one perſon onely, but in a ſucceſſion of many perſons: which when we affirme, it muſt not be preiudiciall to thoſe holy Biſhops, who for Chriſts ſake ſpent their bloud at Rome vnder the Emperours: but to the ſhame of their Succeſſors, who forſaking the rule of holy Scripture, haue ſpilt the blood of other men. For it is not Rome regenerated, and ſuffering, but degenerated and perſecuting muſt be counted the ſeat of the Beaſt with many heads: which notwithſtanding is to be vnderſtood, that to the Beaſt there is but one only head at one time, more ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whom God hath permitted

               <p>NEither ſuffer your ſelfe, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by them who ſhal tell you that Chriſt is not openly, expreſſely, and directly denied by Antichriſt ſo properly called. For Antichriſt was not ſo blockiſh, that hee would openly and directly denie Chriſt, by whoſe name and profeſſion hee ſaw ſo much profit and honour to come vnto him; you may bee ſure hee was not ſo madde. It was therefore requiſite that he might both ſatisfie his owne hatred, and ſerue his owne turne, he ſhould denie Chriſt ſecretly, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent &amp; indirectly: for could Antichriſt poſſibly haue held his gouernment ſo manie yeeres in the Church, if he had openly denied Chriſt? certainely hee could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue held it; for all thoſe Chriſtians ouer whom he gouerned, would either haue hiſt him out for a foole, or burnt him vp for a blaſphemour. It was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for Antichriſts profit to deny Chriſt after this manner. Adde moreouer that hee is deſcribed by the Apoſtle to be a cunning and a crafty companion, and that he ſhall come with all deceit of iniuſtice.<note place="margin">Popery is a myſtery of Iniquity.</note> Beſides all his religion is not called iniquitie, but the myſtery of iniquity. And the gloſſe hath noted, that the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call impiety of Antichriſt ſhall bee cloakt ouer with the name of piety. It had beene therefore very abſurd to haue denied Chriſt plainely, openly and expreſſely, for that did no whit agree either with the good of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or the humour of Antichriſt, or the myſtery of Iniquity. It followeth therefore that he denied Chriſt ſecretly, implicitly and indirectly, and retaining the name of Chriſt, did aboliſh his faith and doctrine. <hi>But that belongeth to petty Antichriſts, to denie Chriſt ſecretly and indirectly: but to that great Antichriſt directly and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15182:35"/> openly; wherevpon his comming is called a Reuelation,</hi> as Bellarmine doth ſophiſtically gather. By which words is expreſſed not the manner of the deniall of Chriſt, but the manner of vſurping his kingdome. For if you conſider the manner of doctrine, the apoſtacie of the great Antichriſt is called myſticall, and ſo is his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as of all the reſt, but that their apoſtacie from Chriſt ought to be counted particular, his vniuerſall. And therefore for all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> doth denie Chriſt ſecretly and indirectly, as the <hi>Pope,</hi> who though hee doth in word expreſly and directly confeſſe Chriſt to be God and man, yet he doth cloſely and indirectly denie hoth Chriſts Diuinitie, and his Humanitie.</p>

               <p>He doth confeſſe directly in word, that <hi>Christ</hi> is iuſt and mercifull, but in deed doth indirectly denie both: for perfect iuſtice doth not admit imperfect ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is humane: and perfect mercy doth not grant imperfect pardon; it doth not remit the fault and retayne the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> doth teach that imperfect ſatisfaction and pardon is performed by <hi>Christ</hi> to the faithfull: he doth therefore denie vnto <hi>Chriſt</hi> perfect iuſtice and mercy, and ſo makes <hi>Christ</hi> a plaine I doll.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Pope denieth the three offices of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>HE doth in word acknowledge the three offices of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but indirectly denieth them, his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, his Prieſthood, and his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>His propheſie,<note place="margin">Firſt his Prophecie.</note> while hee telleth vs that the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures, wherein the voice of our Prophet in all things neceſſarie to ſaluation is fully conteyned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be principles of faith, or precepts of life, to be very imperfect. And therefore doth account his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall Epiſtles among the Canonicall Scriptures.<note place="margin">Diſtinc. <hi>9.</hi> Sic omnes.</note> Fie vpon ſuch blaſphemie, and intolerable pride. Herein he is a very <hi>Iew,</hi> in that he abrogateth Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements by mans traditions. For as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had the vnwritten <hi>Cabala</hi> to interpret the old Teſtament; ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> hath brought in his vnwritten traditions, as the Iewiſh <hi>Cabala,</hi> whereby hee doth bring a ſenſe of his owne, what pleaſeth him of the written commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. But with the ſame argument that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did refute the Iewiſh, we doe briefely refute the Popiſh traditions.</p>
               <p>The obſeruation of humane traditions is the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gods heauenly commundements,<note place="margin">Matth: 15.</note> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But Poperie is the obſeruation of humane traditions, witneſſe the Decretalls. Here <hi>Duarenus</hi> ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that it fared ill with mens affaires ſince the decrees had gotten winges, that is, ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls were ſo ſawcie as to flie into the Church ouer the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Therefore Poperie is the abrogation of Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly commandements.</p>
               <p>I will bring one example, wherein it appeareth that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> the Popes ſweet-heart hath by his expoſition
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15182:36"/> ouerthrowne one of the greateſt commandements of the Law.<note place="margin">Bellarmines lewd dealing with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> God ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any likeneſſe to worſhip.</hi> Here Bellarmine diſtinguiſheth; <hi>Thou ſhalt not worſhip an Idoll: But thou ſhalt worſhip an Image.</hi> A diſtinction of the word not of the thing. Far an Image is an Idoll when it is worſhipped. But the worſhipping of an Idoll is Idolatrie: and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement there is no mention made of an Idoll, but of a likenes, and that of euery likenes, which as it were the genus or generall doth comprehend equally both Image and Idoll. But <hi>Idolatrie is to worſhip the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Creator,</hi> yea by your leaue with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor too; for the worſhip of any likenes is abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the law, whether it be worſhipped for God, or with God. And the reaſon of the prohibition is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. Idolatrie is compared to fornication, and God to a iealous husband, who by no meanes will haue the likenes of any thing to be worſhipped either before him or with him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeemeth to alledge the ſame excuſe for his idolatrie, which the harlot doth for her adulterie: for ſhee telleth her iealous husband, I tooke not this Letcher for my Husband, but for my Friend, I tooke him with you, not for you: So this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous minde of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth to God, that is full of iealouſie: I do not worſhip the image for God, but with God, not for the Creator, but with the Creator. But God as a moſt iealous husband doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbid any worſhip of an image, as the lewd imbracing of an adulterer:<note place="margin">Ioh: 9. v. 20.</note> and therefore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the worſhipper of an Idoll, the worſhipper of the Deuill. Now it is plaine that the Pope is a worſhipper of an Idoll, therefore the worſhipper of the Deuill. The Pope oweth me a good turne for ſaying he is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein I feare I ſhall ſeeme to prevaricate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, that while I giue him the name of an Idolater, I take from him the name of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>For Antichrist is not an Idolater, as Bellarmine would haue it.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:15182:36"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pope is an Idolater, as truth it ſelfe would haue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Pope is not Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I counſell the Pope that if he giue credit to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> propoſition, he graunt our aſſumption, ſo while he take to himſelfe the name of an Idolater, hee may happily lay aſide the name of Antichriſt. But he will reſume it, ſo giddie headed and wauering is <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By whoſe confeſſion, <hi>Antichriſt doth worſhip Maozim,</hi> that is as he ſaith the Deuill.</p>
               <p>But the worſhipper of the Deuill is an Idolater.</p>
               <p>Antichriſt therefore is an Idolater.</p>
               <p>But the Pope hath taken to him the note of an Idolater from holy <hi>Iohn:</hi> let him therefore take againe to him the note of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>From hence ariſeth that which I intended to proue, that the Pope doth nothing elſe but abrogate and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate a principall commandement of God with his tradition and oppoſition. What is it to denie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Chriſt, if this be not? what? as though hee hath not only corrupted but alſo peruerted the Goſpell of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Popes fift Goſpell.</note> while hee hath ſuffered a fift Goſpell to be coyned by his <hi>Dominicans,</hi> as Matth: Pariſienſis doth witneſſe. <hi>They called it the Goſpell of the Holy Ghost,</hi>

                  <hi>and the eternall Gospell: wherein they taught that Chriſt is not God, nor his Goſpell the true Goſpell, and that compared to their Goſpell, his was the ſhell, and theirs the kernell.</hi> O blaſphemie to be puniſhed with hell fire.

                     </gap>briel</hi> that deteſtable Paraſite, as though <hi>Clement</hi> had finiſhed the fift Goſpell; which doth not onely giue a blow to the foure Goſpells, but a deadly wound. The authors whereof doe incurre <hi>Pauls</hi> curſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15182:37"/> which is denounced not only to Popes, but to Apoſtles, and Angells, if any ſhall bring in not a contrarie but another Goſpell. Not if any contrarie, but if any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which the Galathians receiued of <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, beſides that which they had receiued out of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and euangelicall Scriptures, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the place; if they doe not only preach or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole Goſpell, but if they doe neuer ſo litle preach beſide the Goſpell, or doe thwart any thing, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath explained the place. For another Goſpell doth not only corrupt, but peruert the Goſpell of Chriſt. The Pope of Rome doth not onely bring in another, but a contrarie, wherein hee doth not onely adde many things, but oppoſe many things againſt the Goſpell of Chriſt. In the one, hee doth weaken the Goſpell; in the other, he deſtroyeth it; for euery ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth import an imperfection, euery oppoſition a falſhood. And therefore Poperie is to be deemed not only a corruption, but a ſubuerſion of the Goſpell. Out of that fift Goſpell is their new Creed of their faith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which conteyneth twelue articles of the faith to be diſcuſſed in the Dialogue following. For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof diuers Popes heretofore tooke great paines, and euery one added a peece of his owne, till it came to full perfection by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and hath been lately printed by your authoritie <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, that the great glory of your omnipotent power in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie might appeare. As likewiſe the conformities of <hi>S. Francis</hi> are lately brought to light, and by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement publiſhed in print, I thinke that typicall Ieſus being brought againe into the world by you might remoue the true Ieſus out of his throne. Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered. Let true Ieſus vtterly confound the typicall Ieſus. Do not theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> the fift manifeſtly proue that thou art that great Antichriſt, who althogh thou do openly in word confeſſe that Chriſt is a Prophet, doſt in very deed indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15182:37"/> denie and ouerthrow the Prophecie of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>More then that, the Pope doth indirectly ouerthrow his Prieſthood and his kingdome.</p>
               <p>His prieſthood whereon dependeth the ſacrifice and interceſſion of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 His Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> while hee doth erect another prieſthood which doth either offer another propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſacrifice, or doth reiterate the ſacrifice of Chriſt as imperfect. When as the Apoſtle doth proue through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> that the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſacrifice of Chriſt if you ſeeke for the number is but one, if for the time is but once offered:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14. Well expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> if for the Prieſt: by himſelfe; if for the place, vpon the Croſſe; if for the manner, bloudily: if for the vertue: exceeding effectuall to make holie the faithfull. With what face therefore doth the Pope either deuiſe another propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſacrifice, or cauſe that to be often repeated of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Prieſts vnbloudily vpon the Altar; as though the bloudy ſacrifice of Chriſt were not ſufficient to make perfect the beleeuers? wherein he ſheweth himſelfe an vtter Aduerſarie vnto Chriſt. <hi>But they doe daily ſacrifice Chriſt ſay they, that they may apply him to the faithfull.</hi> But the Apoſtles did not ſacrifice Chriſt, but propounded him in the word and ſacraments, that they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him to the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Out of the ſacrifice of Chriſt the redemption of the Church is the firſt part of his prieſthood, which the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath communicated with the Saints.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in this verſe ſpeaketh of the ſlaughter of ſoules, which theſe deſtroying Locuſts doe chiefely deuoure.

They neuer heare of Chriſt; They giue eare to the monks, preaching hiſtorically of the croſſe, of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt: but of the vertue of the croſſe, of the benefit of his death, of the efficacy of his reſurrection, (the force and power whereof doth conſiſt in ſpeciall application) not one word.<note place="margin">The Papiſts enemies to certainty of ſaluation.</note> Yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there Doctors cry out that it is preſumption and arrogancy, if the wounded conſcience of a penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be certainely perſwaded by faith, that Chriſt Ieſus is his Sauiour, or that he may confidently truſt he is in the eſtate of grace, vnleſſe an Angell doe ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale

Neither of this do thoſe locuſts feele or teach, who while they depriue their auditours of the holy confidence in Gods mercy,<note place="margin">The manner how Papiſts torment mens conſcience.</note> nor ſuffer them to ſerue God with a ſun-like, but a ſeruile ſpirit, and therefore not with the reioycing of the ſpirit, nor ſuffer them to enioy peace of conſcience in the middeſt of their afflictions, and ſend ſinners trembling for feare to the treaſure of the Church, as popiſh indulgences, and humane ſatisfactions, and ſuch trifling toyes of the ſame kinde.

               <p>For as when a Scorpion ſtings a man with the ſting of his taile, the wound is not preſently felt, but the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poiſon doth afterward ſpred it ſelfe abroad: So thoſe that be hurt by theſe <hi>Loyolane</hi> Scorpions, doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently feele the hurt, but doe by little and little periſh without ſenſe, aſſoone as they ſucke in the venome of their poyſonfull doctrine.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 She is ſaid to worke all her power in his ſight.<note place="margin">She worketh in the ſight of the firſt beaſt.</note> Firſt it is certaine that one and the ſame ſeat the citie with ſeauen hills belongeth to them both, which hath ruled ouer Kings and Princes, which can bee no other then that great Lady Rome. In which ſeate the land-beaſt did ſucceede the ſea-beaſt and deriued all the power of the Romane Empire to herſelfe, ſo that by her owne men it is called the Kingdome of Prieſts, ſhee doth ſhew all the power of the firſt beaſt in his ſight, that is at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 She doth conſtraine the earth and the inhabitants thereof to worſhip the beaſt how will ſome ſay? when the Pope doth enforce the inhabitants of the earth not to worſhippe the Emperour, but himſelfe.</p>
               <p>So you are to vnderſtand the beaſts not to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that did raigne, either in the Empire, or in the Popedome; but thoſe tyrannicall powers, which thoſe beaſtly perſons did put in practiſe. Againe you are to conſider the Papall power to bee truely imperiall, and although it commend it ſelfe vailed with the name of Chriſt, yet that it was brought in by the Dragon, as well as the other; that it might worſhip the Dragon, and be an expreſſe image of the Imperial power, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it the Papall.<note place="margin">The actions of Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> For the Emperor was the cheife Biſhoppe. Now the Emperours did belch out blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt God, condemne the true worſhippe of God, oppreſſe the true worſhippers of God, maintaine the worſhippe of Deuills: and did openly ſerue the Dragon, from whom they receiued their tyrannicall power. And what did the Popes?<note place="margin">The action of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Popes.</note> Did they not with a blaſphemous mouth challenge to themſelues the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine name, and godhead with <hi>Domitian?</hi> did they not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15182:46"/> ſcoffe at the grace of Chriſt, with <hi>Iulian?</hi> did they not perſecute the ſeruants of Chriſt, with <hi>Diocleſian?</hi> did they not bring in the worſhip and doctrine of Deuills? and while they did openly profeſſe the name of Chriſt, did they not cloſly and ſecretly ſerue the Dragon? So the difference betweene the Emperours and the Popes about the manner of worſhipping the Dragon was ſomewhat but in plaine truth nothing at all. But heere is a neceſſarie diſtinction to be vſed. There was in the Emperours a blinde ignorance of Chriſt, in the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes a true confeſſion of Chriſt, in their ſucceſſors a fained, who did in word condemne the olde Romane Idolatrie and tyrannie,<note place="margin">What popery is.</note> but did call it backe againe in deede. For <hi>what is poperie indeede if you doe truely weigh many of the parts of it, but refined paganiſme.</hi> The Authors whereof were ſo bewitched of the Deuill, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended one thing, and did another: in intention they worſhipped God, in very deede the Dragon; as decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſo deceiued; the principall Authours of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills worſhip, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith; of the doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. What is popery elſe therefore whether you conſider the worſhippe, or the doctrine but ſecret <hi>Draconiſme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They thinke that they do gaily well, when they call vpon other Mediators, either Angells or Saints: when they adore the Pictures of Saints: <hi>yeelding wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe to the Image</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>which is due to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> whenas the contrary is fit, to giue no worſhippe to the Image when none is due to the ſubſtance. They thinke they do paſſing holily, but indeede they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe the Deuill, when they worſhippe the Image as <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, whence <hi>Lactantius</hi> concludeth, <hi>there is no religion there where there is an Image.</hi> Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Romane Synagogue is voide of religion which is full of Images. The Popes imagine that they be Maſters of abſtinence and continencie, when for conſcience ſake they forbidde meates and marriages:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15182:46"/> when as in truth they bring in the doctrine of deuills, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth. They doe not intend ſo, you will ſay. The murtherer doth not intend to kill his Father, but his enemie; but in ſtead of his enemie hee killeth his Father in the darke: ſhall we ſay hee killed not his father but his enemie, becauſe he intended not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but his enemies death? which if it be abſurd to ſpeake in this outward darknes, do we not thinke it as abſurd in this inward darkneſſe of the ſoule, if any man ſay that he doth worſhip God when hee doth worſhip the Dragon, becauſe hee doth intend to worſhip God not the Dragon? Therefore the Emperours, and the Popes doe agree in a third, that is, in worſhipping the Dragon, from whom they haue receiued their power. Adde hereto that the Pope, in whom the image of the firſt beaſt doth reuiue and liue againe, as ſhall appeare afterward; while he driueth men to worſhip himſelfe, it may be ſaid, that he doth compell them to worſhip the image of the firſt beaſt: from whence thus I diſpute.</p>
               <p>He that compelleth men to worſhip the image of the firſt beaſt, is Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>The Pope doth compell men to worſhip the image of the firſt beaſt.</p>
               <p>The Pope therefore is Antichriſt.</p>

                  <hi>The Pope did neuer bring downe fire in the ſight of men.</hi>

                  <hi>The Pope therefore is not Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition of the former ſyllogiſme taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, is not <hi>S.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee peruerſely collecteth out of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that power is giuen to Antichriſt to giue life, and frame ſpeeches to Images, which may ſeeme as credible to ſober men,<note place="margin">Popiſh falſe miracles.</note> as that the picture of <hi>Memnon being enlightned by the Sunne beames, ſpake very plainely,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth. But grant it be ſo: the aſſumption literally taken agreeth with the Pope, and the popiſh Synagogue, if ye beleeue the Legend. How often by them are images counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to moue, to ſweat, to nodd, to ſpeake in the ſight, and opinion of ſimple people, that they may be allured to the worſhip of thoſe Saints, whoſe images they be?</p>
               <p>There was ſome wonder toward as oft as the image began to ſpeake.<note place="margin">Martialis.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Deuill did often ſpeake in the images of the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15182:48"/> but a Prieſt in the images of the Papiſt, that hee may ſeeme to take the Deuils turne in deluding of men. I retort therefore this argument.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer Church doth make images to ſpeake, in the opinion of men, is Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>But the popiſh Church doth make images to ſpeake in the opinion of men.</p>
               <p>Therefore the popiſh Church is Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now I come to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> latter ſyllogiſme, if firſt I ſhall explaine the ſixt action of the Beaſt: Shee worketh great ſignes, ſo that ſhe maketh fire to deſcend from heauen in the ſight of men.</p>
               <p>The Beaſt that is Antichriſt doth worke great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, v: 13. which bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> calls lying ſignes and wonders. 1. in reſpect of the end, becauſe they ſerue to ſeduce men, Ioh: 14. 2. in reſpect of the matter; for they be either the counterfeytings of lying men, or the wonders of deceitfull ſpirits, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. 3. In reſpect of the forme, for whereas true miracles doe exceede nature, and are wrought by the omnipotent power of God; falſe wonders are they which are partly effected by naturall cauſes, partly by the power of Sathan. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth well agree with vs in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Falſe miracles.</note>The miracles of the firſt and ſecond kinde haue been infinite in the darke kingdome of Antichriſt: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of Spirits, the viſions of Angells, our <hi>Ladie</hi> how often hath ſhee come gliding out of heauen? how often haue the miſerable ſoules crept puling out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, beſetting high-wayes, and recounting their torments to procure men to pittie them? hence the market of Purgatorie is growne very gainefull, and the bargaines about ſinnes very profitable. Then could the Images walke a foote; then could the Bells ſtrike alone without helpe; then could the Angells like Quoriſters chant it out in Canterburie Minſter, and play vpon <hi>Dunſtans</hi> Harpe; then could the Apoſtles come downe

Soules ſo whipt with rodds, that they had rather beene in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. So they couerd all their tricks and conueyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their kinde of deceit, and their manner of working with the feare of puniſhment. Of theſe miracles <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, which being meerely falſe had a ſhew of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but not the power, being the deuiſes of cogging companions. There were other miracles of deceiueable ſpirits, which were wrought partly by the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes, partly by the power of Satan. So that that Synagogue ſeemed to be another <hi>Canidia. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ doth make fire to deſcend from heauen in the view of men,</hi> ſaith S.

               <p>In all theſe Antichriſt is Gods Ape. For he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and approued the ſacrifice of the Maſſe and Tranſſubſtantiation with miracles:<note place="margin">The Maſſe confirmed by a falſe miracle.</note> witneſſe that pillar of fire from heauen, falling to the earth, euen vpon that place, where by the negligence of the Prieſt, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend reports, the bodie of God fell out of the pixe vpon the graſſe: that pillar of fire ſhining like the Sunne was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15182:49"/> about the bodie of God, ſo that all the beaſts of the field, except a blacke Horſe, which bended but one of his leggs, bended all their foure leggs to the bodie. Which miracle I haue brought out of the Legend, that I might gratifie <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who knowes that beaſts then were well nurtured, like to his leane iade, that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to eat his meat, did adore the ſacrament vpon his knees: which the beaſts had not done if God forſooth had not brought downe the fiery pillar from heauen, whereby they might haue diſcerned the bodie of God lying vpon the graſſe. Adde hereto that Antichriſt doth beſtow the grace of the ſpirit, &amp; ſanctification, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Agneit Dei,</hi> his hallowed graines, his holy water, and his bells, as <hi>Primaſius</hi> hath it. Further, hee ſtriketh his enemies with vengeance from God, as it were with fire fallen from heauen, but that in the conceit of men, that they whom Antichriſt his furie doth daunt, may ſeeme to be wounded with heauenly reuenge, as it were with fire falne from aboue. Which whether it be true of the flaſh of excommunication, which the Pope, who is called the God of reuenge, caſts abroad, let Kings looke to it, whoſe kingdomes haue been often ſet on fire by ſuch popiſh lightning. But to excommunicate a King is, ſay they, no miracle. But ſo to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a King that you caſt him out of his kingdome, and releaſe ſubiects from the obedience of their Kings, it is a great miracle, that either Kings are ſo patient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, or Subiects ſo madde to beleeue. Wherefore this is not materiall fire, but myſticall, brought downe from heauen by Antichriſt in the ſight of men, not that he doth ſo indeed, but that he ſeemeth ſo to doe. Although if the literall ſenſe doe more content you, I haue found out <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth,<note place="margin">Gregor: the 7. miracle.</note> that notable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, who could ſtrike fire out of his boſome, as oft as he liſted. Thus I infer.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer in the conceits of ſimple men doth ſeeme to bring downe reuenging fire out of heauen, is Antichriſt.</p>

               <p>I Proceede. The Beaſt is ſayd to imprint his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter vpon all, both great and ſmall, to bee carried ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their fore-head, or their right hand. Wherein he doth peruerſly follow Chriſts character, which GOD doth imprint vpon his ſeruants, ſubiection to Chriſt, and the acknowledging of him to bee their head and Sauiour. And it is partly inward, partly outward.<note place="margin">Chriſts chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of two ſorts.</note> The inward character is true faith imprinted vpon the ſoule by the ſpirit of God, whereby we beleeue that Chriſt is our onely Redeemer. The outward character, is the confeſſion of the mouth, &amp; the operation of the hands. And therfore a Chriſtian doth beare the marke of God in his heart by faith, in his fore-head by profeſſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> in his hand by working, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath expounded: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the two ſacraments are the ſeales of faith, the witneſſes of profeſſion, and the practiſes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">The diuers characters of the Pope.</note>

               <p>In like ſort Antichriſt hath a marke proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his owne, which he doth imprint and brand the Antichriſtians withall. Which character hangs vpon his name, and his name vpon his ſtate. Of the firſt Beaſt that is of the Romane or Latine monarchie,<note place="margin">The ſeauen formes of go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romanes.</note> there were ſeauen heads, that is, ſeuen kingly formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning the common-weale. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. 2. <hi>Conſuls.</hi> 3. <hi>Decemviri.</hi> 4. <hi>Tribunes</hi> of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 5 <hi>Dictators.</hi> 6. <hi>Emperors</hi> properly called. 7 <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</hi> The ſtate of the Beaſt is Romane or Latine.

And Antichriſt doth ſo imprint all his with the marke of the Beaſt, that hee will ſuffer none to buy or ſell, except they be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Beaſts marke.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15182:53"/> new Empire, for the name and title, and is one of the ſeuen: that is, of the Emperours. Therefore although the old Empire may ſeeme to be deſcribed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell by the name of the beaſt, yet a new is chiefly ſet out, which the ſecond beaſt did renew, that the Whoore might ſit vpon it, and be vpholden by it. What is more perſpicuous then this Angelicall interpretation, which euent it ſelfe hath prooued true? for the whore ſitteth vpon this heaſt and is vpheld by it. For therefore the Romaine in name, but the <hi>Germaine</hi> Emperour in deed is called as I ſaid the <hi>Defendor Procurator and Protectour of the Apoſtolicke ſea.</hi> Out of the premiſſes I ſhortly diſpute.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The beaſt whereon the Whore ſitteth is a new Empire; for it is not the ſixt head but the eight, therefore not Ethnick Rome vnder the Pagans, but in name only Chriſtian vnder the Chriſtian Emperours is that Whore deſcribed by Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>

               <p>WHoſe glorious profeſſion is fitly reſembled to the golden cuppe of fornication. It is ſaid that <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. King of England had three Concubines the firſt very deuout, the ſecond very ſubtill, the third very pleſant. The whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> alone doth expreſſe theſe three diſpoſitions. For what is more deuout, what is more ioconde, what is more wily? ſhee hath a face none of her owne, as her Husband Antichriſt hath not. For he doth alwaies weare a viſard, and therefore is a counterfeit Antichriſt. A whore, not only for her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall filthineſſe, but for her ſpirituall Idolatrie, whereto ſhe hath entiſed the nations with her allurements, ſuch as had to do with her. She is therefore a blaſphemous and filthy Whore, more then that a proud, couetous, cruell whore. And therefore ſhe is ſaid to bee decked with purple and golden attire, inriched with the ſpoiles of all ſorts, and drunke with the innocent bloud of the Saints.<note place="margin">Note</note> For what extremities ſoeuer impietie could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by blaſphemie, or luſt by laciuiouſneſſe, or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe by rapine, or pride by delicacie, or crueltie by torture, the ſame the Angell ſo long before foretould that the Church ſhould endure by that whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:15182:54"/> Neither if we grant that Ethnicke Rome from her cradell was <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe the beaſt is ſaid to haue 7. heades, any inconuenience will follow thereby. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if wee ſhall ſay that the purple whore began then,<note place="margin">The Pope compared to <hi>Romulus.</hi>
                  </note> when <hi>Romulus</hi> firſt founded Rome will it ouerthrowe the expoſition of the Angell. For it remained to bee that, which ſhe was in the beginning. Yea a great deale worſe when it was falſly Chriſtian vnder Antichriſt, then heatheniſh vnder <hi>Romulus.</hi> It is reported that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> was a notable theife, a Deflowrer of Virgins, a truce breaker, a brother-killer, and that hee founded Rome at the firſt by theſe ſinnes. But he was not ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for his theifts, as this for his ſacriledge. Nor he ſo filthy for the forcing of Virgins, as this for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images: Nor he for his breaking his league with men, as this with God: Nor he ſuch a ſpiller of his brothers blood, as this of Chriſtian blood. What an one thinke we him to be, who doth ſurpaſſe a theefe in robberie, a deflowrer of Virgins in lechery, a truce breaker in treacherie, and a brother-killer in crueltie. Therefore the Angell called the Biſhop of Rome <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and the purple whore by a ſuper excellencie.<note place="margin">The deſcripti- of the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </note> For ſhe was proude by the ſpoiles of Prouinces, this by the ſpoiles of all Churches. She was compoſed or carnall, this of ſpirituall adulteries and whoredomes. She brak her faith with men, this with God. Shee was enraged againſt the bodies of the Saints, this againſt the ſoules of the Saints. She dealt with the lambes of Chriſt by open force as a Lyons Whelpe, this as a Foxe with her cunning did ſauagely teare them in peeces and deuour them. Wherefore let Rome if you will, bee that whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> from the beginning: certainely ſhe could not make drunke 10. kings with the golden cuppe of her fornication, before there were tenne Kings. For while Ethnicke Rome did ſtand, they were the Emperours ſubiects, they were no kings: They were kings vnder the Pope of Rome, therefore by popiſh Rome made
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15182:55"/> drunke, to whom by an excellencie the name of that whore is giuen by the Angell. Neither yet will I euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that Biſhoply Rome, which ſuffred for Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ethnicke Emperours. For not Rome regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſuffering, but degenerating and perſecuting can properly be called that whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Neither doe I wholy excuſe the imperiall Rome,<note place="margin">Imperiall Rome not to be excuſed.</note> which vnder <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, Theodoſius</hi> and other holy Emperours profeſſed Chriſt: becauſe Rome which was <hi>Babylon</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, did retaine in her boſome diuers reliques of the former paganiſme, and diuers ſeedes of the future Antichriſtianiſme. Becauſe it is not neceſſarie that all that were of the ſame ſucceſſion ſhould be of the ſame affection. No I would not exclude <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the hope of ſaluation, if the wretched ſinner would repent, and returne vnto his God. Hence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſpute againſt vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antichriſt cannot be ſaued: for he is the ſonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Apoſtle teacheth.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pope therefore is not Antichriſt.</hi> Or thus.</p>

                  <hi>It is not lawfull to pray for Antichriſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This obiection is a fallacie, called the begging of the queſtion. For it doth preſuppoſe Antichriſt to be one ſingular man. We contrary; as by many reaſons wee haue proued it. If therefore they keepe them to the point, and take the Pope collectiuely, the aſſumption is falſe, if they take him for this or that ſingle man, the aſſumption is true, if the Pope repent. But then there be foure tearms in the ſyllogiſme. For the Pope is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe taken in the aſſumption, then in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

               <p>BVt heere is another doubt to bee reſolued, how the ſeate of Antichriſt can be called that purple whore, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, and temple and Church of God as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>For if Antichriſt ſit in the Church of God as I taught before, and popiſh Rome be the ſeat of Antichriſt, as in many wordes I haue declared, it ſeemeth that popiſh Rome is the Church of God. I anſwere and diſtinguiſh of the propoſition, and that out of Gods booke, which conſidereth the Church after 2. ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. After the inward truth, and the outward profeſſion.</item>
                  <item>2. After the outward profeſſion only.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As bleſſed <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> the Church of Chriſt although it had greeuouſly fallen from the doctrine of Chriſt. Why ſo? Becauſe as yet it profeſſed the name of Chriſt, and retained the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme, and becauſe certain lay hid among them, who had not polluted themſelues. So the Church of Rome may bee called the Church of God and of Chriſt, becauſe it profeſſeth the name of Chriſt, becauſe it retaineth certaine footſteps and outward markes of a viſible Church, as Baptiſme, the Decalogue, the <hi>creed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Papiſts haue the truth as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> had the Arke.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lords Prayer:</hi> but notes miſerably corrupted: as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> who retained among them the Arke of Gods preſence, but they felt it to bee to them the Arke of peſtilence: as the <hi>Cutthites</hi> the baſtard <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had <hi>Moſes</hi> bookes, and would at once feare God and worſhip Idoles: As the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> their ſucceſſors, who brag'd that they had <hi>Iacobs</hi> well among them, when they had infected the well of the water of life.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15182:56"/> Therefore the Delegates did iuſtly complaine of the Church of Rome in the Councell of Trent: <hi>That that was true which God complained by Ieremie: This people haue committed two euills; one, they haue forſaken me the fountaine of liuing water: The other they haue digged to themſelues ceſternes, which can hold no water.</hi> Although I cannot denie that certaine relikes of the inuiſible Church doe lie hidden in the ſame, who haue not ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> But as it is ſaid to the Church of Sardis, <hi>You haue a name that you liue, but you are dead,</hi> that may deſeruedly be ſpoken of the Romiſh Church, in reſpect of the inward faith the ſoule of the Church, you are ſtarke dead, although in outward profeſſion you are ſaid to liue. You are called the Temple of God, becauſe you reteyne the name of Chriſt, but you are the whore of Babylon, becauſe you haue forſaken the faith. The temple of God equiuocally, not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocally, for an equiuocall Church is good enough for aequiuocating Chriſtians. Now the ten hornes, that is the ten Kings, haue one purpoſe, as the Angell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to giue ouer his virtue and his power to the beaſt. Her they will ſerue, they will loue and ſeeke after her; her they will ſuſteyne with their forces, at her booke they will draw the ſword, and being confederaed in holy leagues both with the beaſt and within themſelues, will fight with the Lambe: but after that, the Lambe ſhall by litle and litle begin to weaken and conſume Antichriſt by the preaching of his word, then the ten hornes which before had to doe with the whore, ſhall begin to hate her, and leaue her forſaken and naked.</p>

               <p>AS the Angell doth continue his prophecie to the laſt ouerthrow of the whore, which cannot agree with heatheniſh and imperiall Rome; for this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw doth follow the diſſolution of the old Empire, and the diuiſion thereof into ten kingdomes, which according to the prophecie would that the whore ſhould firſt periſh, afterward themſelues ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and deſtroy it. Therefore this ouerthrow belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to Rome that is popiſh, but chriſtian in name, as the Angell did notably expound it; for whereas ſhee is ſaid to ſit vpon many waters, that is, many people and many nations, as the Angell expounds it, ver: 15. and whereas the woman is called the great Citie, which beareth rule ouer the Kings of the earth, ver: 18. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth hinder but that it may be popiſh Rome. But that popiſh Rome is not rightly ſaid to haue gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: firſt it is ſufficient that Rome then Imperiall, is deſcribed to be the ſeate wherein the whore of Babylon ſhall beare rule afterward. Againe, they which call her the kingdome of the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Turrianus.</note> the kingdome of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> doe confeſſe that ſhee beareth rule, who haue very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly changed the ſecular kingdome into a ſpirituall, that which <hi>Aquinas</hi> the <hi>Angelicall Doctor</hi> doth obſerue.<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> But ſo excellent a prophecie did not onely looke into the age then preſent, but foreſaw the age long after to follow. And therefore the deſcription of the whore is firſt ſet out in all her parts as you ſee, and after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which cannot be vnderſtood of the burning of Ethnicke Rome by the Gothes and Vandales,<note place="margin">10</note> but by a finall and ſodaine deſtruction, as it were a myll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15182:57"/> caſt by great force into the ſea. For it ſhall not ſaith the Angell, be found againe any more: which cannot agree to Ethnicke Rome, for after it had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that dangerous wound by the Gothes, it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cured and reſtored to health. Beſides, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell doth adde that the deſtruction of the whore ſhall be for euer: which although it doe agree with Rome Ethnicke, yet that you may ſee it likewiſe agreeth with Rome popiſh, the woman ſaith the Angell, which is the great Citie, together with her falſe Prophet ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire. Let the litle froggs take heed to themſelues, thoſe foule ſpirits the Ieſuites, which iſſue daily out of the mouth of the Dragon, the beaſt and the falſe Prophet. <hi>Bellarmine, Becan,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe frogs, may merrily ſcoffe and laugh at our men (but with a Sardonian laughter) becauſe the <hi>Citie and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> as they write, <hi>to vs are both one, as the ſtreet &amp; Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus:</hi> for the woman which is the great Citie, together with her falſe Prophet ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire. Here is no diſtinction of deſtruction: for both the ſeat, and he that holdeth the ſeat ſhall periſh for euer. <hi>But Chriſtian Rome ſhall not periſh,</hi> ſay they. True, if the truth agreed with the name: but the Antichriſtian whore ſhall be vtterly ouerthrowne. Therefore the Angell cryeth out, <hi>Come out of Babylon my people, leſt as yee be partakers of her ſinnes, you be likewiſe partakers of her plagues.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> which place <hi>Hierome</hi> doth alledge in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcella,</hi> whom he perſwadeth to come out of Rome now, not heatheniſh but popiſh, becauſe it is Babylon: which the very Papiſts themſelues do grant to be the ſeat of Antichriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> I demand therefore at the laſt, whether they make Ethnicke Rome to be the ſeate of Antichriſt, becauſe hee then ſate at Rome, when the Ethnicke Emperours gouerned there, or whether he ſhould ſit afterward when they were worne out. If they ſay he ſate at Rome with the Ethnicke Emperors, they ouerthrow all the tale of Antichriſt vtterly, whom

For whereas they goe about to proue out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is the ſeat of Antichriſt, thereof I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more properly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.

               <p>Myſticall Babylon is the ſeat and Citie of Antichriſt deſcribed in the 17 and 18 of the Apocalyps by the confeſſion of the Aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>But Rome chriſtian in name and popiſh is that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Babylon, as the expoſition of the Angell doth manifeſtly convict.</p>
               <p>Rome therefore in name chriſtian and popiſh, is the ſeat and citie of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>This is the Angells expoſition, <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, not mine: this expoſition if you haue any ſenſe at all pierceth to the quicke, it galls and wounds exceedingly. This ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme doth inwardly lanche and wound theſe your worthy Aduocates, though they ſeeme to haue litle ſenſe, made like a darte, by the expoſition of the Angell, to be caſt and aymed at them. For what are they elſe but the ſhameleſſe bawdes of the whore? what do they elſe, but with their cunning netts of words, and with their learned ſnares deceiue and catch ſimple people,<note place="margin">Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> that they may bring them to that withered and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne whore, whom they paint out with all their boxes of their ſlaberments. But as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaid of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that coloured her face with painting, that <hi>God would not acknowledge her in the reſurrection for his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that may more truly be ſaid of this ſame hagged and painted whore, of whom we ſpeake.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Wherein is ſet downe the time when Antichriſt is reuealed.</head>
               <p>I Haue ſpoken much of the ſeat wherein ſhee doth gouerne, now ſomewhat of the time when ſhee ſhall be reuealed. For Antichriſt lurkt cloſely a long time, and cloſely grew by degrees, as an earth-quake,<note place="margin">A notable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of an earth-quake.</note> which doth not ſhew it ſelfe ſtraight way, but beginneth firſt by a litle winde, and then being ſhut vp and kept in, in certaine hollow caues of the earth, making no motion or ſound, but by litle and litle gathering great ſtrength, at laſt violently breaketh out,<note place="margin">The degrees of an earth-quake.</note> teares the earth in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhatters rocks, caſts downe mountaines, ouerturnes Towers, ſubuerts Cities, ſwallowes vp Riuers, inflames the ayre, bringeth forth lightning, filleth the heauens with dreadfull noyſe, and the world with terrible feare. Such is the working of an earth-quake, ſmall, litle and hidden at the firſt, great and terrible after it breakes out. Such for all the world is the working of Antichriſt. In the beginning, like a litle winde, it lyeth hid in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hollow cells of the Church, afterward by degrees growing bigger, and gathering ſtrength, it doth agaſte the world. Inſinuating himſelfe at the firſt with a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cloake of ſanctitie, creepeth ſecretly into mens mindes: at the laſt ſhall appeare, and breake out open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their deſtruction, after that which hindreth is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, as the Apoſtle teacheth. It is agreed on both ſides, that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith hindreth,<note place="margin">What hindred the reuealing of Antichriſt. <hi>De reſur: car:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ:</hi> 2.6.</note> that Antichriſt which then was might not be reuealed was the Roman Empire, as all the Fathers thought, <hi>Tertullian, Ambroſe, Chryſostome, Cyrill, Primaſius, Theophylact</hi> vpon this place, <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Algaſia queſt.</hi> 11. vnleſſe better you know what deteyneth the comming of Chriſt, that Antichriſt ſhould firſt be reuealed in his time, as that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15182:59"/> learned <hi>Iewell</hi> doth expound out of the former words. The day of Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſhall not come, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there come a falling away firſt, and vnleſſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt be reuealed ver: 7. hee teacheth who doth keepe backe the comming of Chriſt, onely he which detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſhall deteyne till he be cleane taken away: which all the Fathers almoſt, as I ſaid, vnderſtand of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour, about the end of whoſe fall they ſay that Antichriſt ſhall come. The Apoſtle vſed firſt the newter gender, v: 6. then the maſculine, v: 7. By the one ſome thinke he meant the Romane Empire, by the other the Romane Emperour. For ſo long as the Rom: Empire floriſhed, or the Romane Emperour bare rule, Antichriſt could not ſit &amp; domineere in that ſeat: he lay cloſe at that time and durſt not ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The Emperour who hindred him was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way, that Antichriſt might openly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne at Rome; that the Popes chaire might there be placed in ſtead of Caeſars throne. But herein the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries diſſent from vs; <hi>That the Rom: Empire</hi> they ſay, <hi>ſhould be vtterly ouerthrowne and ended, ſo as not ſo much as the name of the Rom: Empire ſhould remaine, before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt came.</hi> Which as ſoone as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſaid, he denied: in which contradiction, as in many others, that great learned Biſhop of Ely takes him tardie. Truly that which hee ſaid, neither the Apoſtle hath ſaid, or any Father hath ſaid. The Apoſtle hath taught, that that which hindred muſt be taken out of the way, and remoued out of his place, ſo farre forth as it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the reuelation and domination of Antichriſt, hee did not teach it ſhould be aboliſhed and ouerthrowne, as they ſay, ſo that he ſhould loſe his name: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of the Empire is one thing, the aboliſhing is another.<note place="margin">The Roman Empire is not diſſolued but diuided into 10 Kings.</note> The Emperour is gone out of the Citie of Rome, the Rom: Empire is diſſolued and diuided into ten Kings, therefore Antichriſt is now come. This is therefore the concluſion of all thoſe Fathers, whom I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15182:59"/> mentioned before. Hee that held is taken away, ſayth <hi>Hierome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Geront. de Monoga.</note> and doe we not vnderſtand that Antichriſt is neere at hand? for ſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, the ten hornes ſhall receiue the Kingdome together with the Beaſt, that is, with Antichriſt, and the ten Kings ſhall diuide the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire among themſelues (the number of ten is often taken indefinitely.) You haue heard the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, marke the euent. <hi>The tenne hornes haue receiued the Kingdome, and haue diuided the Romane Empire among themſelues, together with the Beast, that is, with Antichriſt:</hi> by the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Therefore Antichriſt is now come. <hi>But the name of the Romane Empire is not aboliſhed.</hi> Neither ought it to be aboliſhed; for S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught, that the ſixt head of the Sea-Beaſt, that is, the Empire,<note place="margin">The ſixt head of the Sea-beaſt.</note> after it was deadly wounded ſhould bee cured and healed againe: not therefore to bee vtterly taken away and finiſhed, as they ſay, ſo that it retaine not the name of an Empire. Againe, hee ſets out the cauſe, why the ſecond Beaſt, that is, Antichriſt ſhould renew the image of the former Beaſt, that the whore might ſit vpon her, as I haue taught, and bee ſuſtained by her. And therefore the former Beaſt was not cleane to be taken away, leſt the latter being depriued of her ſtay, ſhould fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>But how doth S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> then agree?<note place="margin">An obiection anſvvered.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the Emperour muſt be taken out of the way, that he might leaue Rome empty for Antichriſt, as the Papiſts expound it: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, that the whore ſitteth vpon the Beaſts backe, that is, the Emperour, that ſhe might be vpheld by him. How doe you recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe? will you ſay, if you vnderſtand <hi>S. Paul</hi> to ſpeake of the olde, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of the new Empire. <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Empire which hindred or detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of that onely, for ſo he ſaith, <hi>He onely that now hindreth ſhall binder, till it bee taken away.</hi> The old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire did hinder Antichriſt not the new. S. <hi>Paul</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake not of the new Empire, but of the olde. S.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15182:60"/> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of the Empire that carrieth the Beaſt, that is ſo farre off from hindring it, that it doth rather vnderprop and vphold it. And to that purpoſe was the Empire renewed in the Weſt,<note place="margin">The Empire renewed in the Weſt, to vphold the Pope.</note> that it might hold vp the Church of Rome. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore doth not in this place ſpeake of the olde Empire, but of the new. But the Popiſh ſort, who thinke that not the Maieſtie onely, but the name of the Empire is to bee extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, before Antichriſt come, doe ſeeme by obſcuring the propheſie with certaine contradictions to delude their Auditours. They ſay that the Romane Empire which now is, ſhall continue to the end of the world by the propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the ſame men ſay, that it ſhall be diſſolued and diuided into tenne Kings (Very fooliſhly; they ſay it notwithſtanding) before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt come. As though tenne very potent Kingdomes could conſiſt of the naked name, and vaine title of an Emperour, or that that could bee ſaid of them, ſhould be vtterly aboliſhed before Antichriſt came, which by them is ſayd, ſhall continue till the end of the world. Wherein in the one, they ſeeme to follow the madnes of Epicurus, who ſeemes to make the world of moates, as theſe men make ten Kingdoms of words. For what is now the Romane Empire, but a meere word? In the other they ſhew their brains to be crackt, who ſay, that the Romane Empire that now is, ſhall continue to the worlds end, and yet ſhall bee vtterly ouerthrowen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Antichriſt, whom they ſay ſhall raigne three yeeres and a halfe before the end of the world. In them both they ſhew their notable impiety, who while they wrape and infold a moſt waighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Antichriſt, within their impoſſibilities &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions they prophane Gods Word, and deceiue Gods Church. The ſumme of all is gathered by the Apoſtle, that the olde Empire is to be taken away, and to be diſſolued and diuided into tenne Kingdomes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Antichriſt ſhould come, that the new was to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15182:60"/> be reſtored and repaired, being the image of the olde, vpon whoſe backe hee ſhould ſit and aduance himſelfe when he came.</p>

               <p>THe olde Empire therefore whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake which hindred the reuealing of Antichriſt, let vs conſider how it was taken out of the way: whereof we put two degrees.

The empty ſeat of the Empire, the Maieſty thereof diuided and diminiſhed, then firſt in the Weſt, and after in the Eaſt put out and ouerthrowen, wee ſay to bee the two degrees of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing of that obſtacle, which hindred the reuealing of Antichriſt, and his dominion in the city of Rome. I trip ouer the hiſtory briefely, they that will ſet faſter footing, may fetch it out of the fountaines themſelues, if they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I doe likewiſe ſet downe two degrees of the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichriſt. One wherein he beganne to raigne,<note place="margin">Two degrees of reuealing Antichriſt.</note> the other wherein hee beganne to bee acknowledged.</p>
               <p>I note alſo two degrees of the Kingdome, when it tooke vpon it the cheefe gouernment of the vniuerſall Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 607. when he was called vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop by <hi>Phocas</hi> that <hi>King-killer,</hi> at that very time when <hi>Mahomet</hi> beganne, ſo that <hi>Phocas</hi> the murtherer,<note place="margin">When <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> began.</note> the Vniuerſall Biſhop, and wicked <hi>Mahomet</hi> may ſeeme to bee of one birth. The winde of falſe doctrine, and of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15182:61"/> Church-ambition, did by ſtealth creep into the minds of certaine Biſhops,<note place="margin">Socrat. li. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>11</hi>
                  </note> who, as <hi>Socrates</hi> is witneſſe, lifting vp themſelues aboue the limits of their Prieſthood, into ſtrange gouernment, did ſtriue about the primacie and ſuperiority ouer all Churches: and to that purpoſe <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> and <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> did foyſt in a new deuiſed Canon of the counſell of <hi>Neece,</hi> detected and reiected by the Biſhops of Carthage. But that ſmall winde kept in, I know not how in the heart of the Church, it did not all breake out before <hi>Boniface</hi> the third had extorted that proud title from <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, by his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate entreaty.</p>
               <p>But yet Antichriſt was but a Pupill as it were in his nonage, not onely being ſubject to the Emperour for a time, but the Emperours Vice Gerent in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rauenna: by whom the election of the Pope firſt made by the Cleargie and people of Rome, was neceſſarily confirmed, vntill <hi>Benedict</hi> the ſecond obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this priuiledge of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the fourth, <hi>Pogonotus,</hi> that the Pope ſhould be created with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the confirmation of the Emperour. And then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt beganne to bee his owne man, liuing after his owne law, or rather without law, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Not long after, as <hi>Boniface</hi> the third did extoll himſelfe aboue all Biſhops; ſo <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſecond vaunted, that hee was aboue the Emperour: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="523"/> 
                  <hi>Gregorie</hi> the third did ſpoyle <hi>Leo</hi> the third, being firſt excommunicated by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond, becauſe hee went about to aboliſh images, did ſpoyle, I ſay, him of all his reuenues in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and abſolued his ſubiects from their oath of fealty.

                  <hi>But Antichriſt ſhall come not in Gods name, but in his owne,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Antichriſt therefore is not the Meſſias of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But he proueth out of two places of the Scripture that Antichriſt is the Meſſias of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> one, <hi>if another ſhall come in his owne name</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>Ioh. 5. him you ſhall receiue.</hi> Whereout of a compound ſuppoſition of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15182:64"/> an indefinite perſon <hi>if another,</hi> hee doth inferre a ſimple propoſition definitely, that is that Antichriſt <hi>abſurdly,</hi> nor well applied to the purpoſe. Which ſets downe that <hi>that Antichriſt ſhall come a little before the end of the world.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Iewes</hi> therefore, whom Chriſt ſpake to then aliue now dead, could not receiue Antichriſt for Meſſias. Vnleſſe peraduenture as he tells vs <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall returne before the end who ſhall reſiſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,<note place="margin">A great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</note> ſo he imagines the <hi>Iewes</hi> that Chriſt ſpake to ſhall riſe againe before the generall reſurrection to receiue Antichriſt. But ſee how vntowardly the parts of this tale hangs together. For he ſaith, <hi>That Enoch and Elias ſhould be killed of Antichriſt, and after three daies and a halfe liue againe: and that it ſhall come to paſſe afterward, that the Iewes being conuerted by that miracle ſhall kill their Meſſias in the mount oliue, and ſhall returne to Chriſt, who ſhall come</hi> 45. <hi>daies after.</hi> Which dreame of his he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in another place which he bringeth. The Apoſtle ſaith that to them who receiue not the loue of the truth, to their ſaluation, God will ſend the working of error, to beleeue lies, and ſo to be iudged with the iudgement of condemnation 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Wo be to thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who haue not receiued Chriſt, The Iewes.</hi> Although the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith not, who receiued not the truth 1. Chriſt, but who receiued not the loue of the truth: as falſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But how ſhall God puniſh thoſe <hi>Iewes?</hi> God ſhall ſend vpon them the working of error, that they might beleeue a lye 1: Antichriſt, and ſhould bee damned. Therefore <hi>the Iewes ſhall receiue Antichriſt</hi> for Meſſias.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth affirme <hi>that the Iewes ſhall bee conuerted by Enoch and Elias, and therefore ſhall bee ſaued.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of men reiecting Chriſt, and therefore to be condemned, he ſpeakes not therefore of the <hi>Iewes. But the Apoſtle ſaith that Antichriſt is ſent to them, who would not receiue Chriſt, which of the Iewes is true, of the Chriſtians falſe.</hi> Yea he ſaith that he is ſent to ſeduce thoſe who haue not receiued the loue of truth,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15182:64"/> which doth well agree with the Papiſts thoſe falſe-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Who although they receiue Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Papiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſt but not the loue of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> receiue not the loue of Chriſt. But the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the time paſt. <hi>Who haue not receiued the loue of truth, not in the future; Therefore he vnderſtandeth the Iewes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle wrote this, refuſed to beleeue the preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the ſinne and puniſhment of Antichriſtians, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth a ſinne going before, did expreſſe their ſinne in the pretertenſe, which is not to be referred to the time of the Epiſtle which <hi>Paul</hi> writ, but to the time of the puniſhment which he enioyned. But if the Ieſuite doe vrge the pretertenſe ſo farre, as if the Apoſtle ſhould vnderſtand, that Antichriſt ſhould be receiued of them only, who had reiected Chriſt before that time, hee muſt hold that he muſt be receiued of them in the end of the world who were dead a thouſand fiue hundred yeares before. And is not this a worthy demonſtration,<note place="margin">A popiſh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.</note> whereby he proueth that Antichriſt ſhall bee in Office the Meſſias of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to be receiued of them in the end of the world? whence as one error begets another, he concludeth <hi>that he is by nation a Iew, by Religion cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed &amp;c.</hi> I haue wonne it now that Antichriſt is an Apoſtata-chriſtian. It followeth therefore that hee can by no meanes bee an Infidell <hi>Iew,</hi> who as yet was not come to Chriſt. I prooued that hee was an inward and hypocriticall enemy who denied Chriſt ſecretly &amp; indirectly. It followeth then that the <hi>Iew</hi> no waies can be an outward and profeſſed enemy who denieth Chriſt directly and plainely. I conclude both out of the Scripture and out of the fathers, that Antichriſt was to ſit in the Temple of God that was in the Church. And therefore that Antichriſt was not to ſit in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ieruſalem. Hierome</hi> with many other Fathers haue determined. And yet this <hi>Pythagoras</hi> who thinks that his <hi>he ſaid</hi> ſo will ſatisfie fooles, doth boldly affirme <hi>that he ſhall ſit in the Temple of Ieruſalem to be builded againe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15182:65"/> by him.</hi>

               <p>Therefore he ſhall ſit in the Temple of the deuill not therefore in the Temple of God. Vnleſſe happily he will change the temple of God into the temple of the Deuill.

The aſſumption alſo is very falſe: for the holy Ghoſt doth call not Ieruſalem but Rome, or rather the Rom: Empire, that great Citie in whoſe ſtreets the bodies of thoſe two witneſſes ſhall lye ſlaine: and that great Citie is called ſpiritually <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> where our Lord was crucified. <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> aboue is called the holy Citie after Chriſt his paſſion, how then here is it ſpiritually called <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egipt?</hi>

               </q>
               <p>We denie the aſſumption. At Rome in that great Citie, that is, in the Romane Empire, our Lord was crucified.

Secondly, becauſe Chriſt in his members is often crucified at Rome. Thirdly, he was not crucified within Ieruſalem but without, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> witneſſeth to the Heb: cap: 13. v. 12. Laſtly, becauſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem before the Apocalyps, which was extant about
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15182:66"/> the end of <hi>Domitian,</hi> being vtterly ouerthrowne, together with their Temple, was neuer to be built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as we haue formerly euicted out of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>that the deſolation of the Temple and Citie ſhall continue vntill the end of the world,</hi> as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> expounds out of the words of Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Enoch and Elias must come againe from heauen to earth, to wit, thoſe two witneſſes, who preach the Goſpell in their owne perſons, and fighting with Antichriſt ſhall be killed by him, and ſhall riſe againe after three daies and a halfe.</hi> and the reſt which out of the 11 of the Apocalyps, they miſerably by force preſſe out, by wringing the letter, ſo that they ſeeme to play the Iewes in no place more. Although in that place neither <hi>Enosh,</hi> nor <hi>Elias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond beaſt miſtaken for the firſt.</note> nor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> as certaine learned men thinke is vnderſtood: for the beaſt that makes warre againſt theſe witneſſes of God, is ſaid to aſcend out of hell, which ſeemes to be the firſt beaſt, which is ſaid to riſe out of the ſea, cap: 13. v. 1. when as the ſecond is ſaid to riſe out of the earth. Againe, the floore of the Church is ſaid to be giuen ouer to be trampled on by the Gentiles 42 monthes v: 2. which time is aſſigned to the perſecution of the firſt beaſt, cap: 13. v. 5. Againe it is to be troden on by the Gentiles not the Iewes, whoſe Prince Antichriſt is faigned to be. Now they which preciſely take the two witneſſes to be two men,<note place="margin">The two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Apoc. 11. not agreed on.</note> could neuer yet agree among themſelues about the perſons. Some that they were <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſome <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus:</hi> ſome not <hi>Elias</hi> but <hi>Ieremie:</hi> others together with <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> thinke that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine is added as a witneſſe aboue number; of <hi>Enoch</hi> none of the Fathers make any recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: of the two Teſtaments, as two witneſſes, and the diuers ſincere Interpreters of the two Teſtaments, who expound the place, they doe more eaſily ſhift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as it ſhall be vnderſtood afterward; who being
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15182:68"/> clad with ſackcloth, in great ſorrow and griefe did preach repentance to the Gentiles, at whoſe hands in ſteed of reward,<note place="margin">Perſecution committed.</note> they receiued moſt cruell death. The cruell perſecution of the firſt beaſt, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the moſt faithfull witneſſes of God, laſted 294 yeeres, which made the 42 monthes, according to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> weekes; whereof more anon. Neither did God ſuffer his witneſſes to die vnreuenged,<note place="margin">Perſecution reuenged.</note> if wee compare the ſtorie to the Prophecie. For God did puniſh thoſe bloody Emperors for his two witneſſes ſake, ſo that the Nations were conſumed by ſharpe and quicke diſeaſes growing by long drought, and too great heat of the Sunne, which bred ſuch plagues, that often deuoured whole Cities, and conſumed whole armies. So happily the two witneſſes may be ſaid to haue ſhut heauen that it ſhould not raine, and to haue opened it that it ſhould raine, whenas by the prayers of the Chriſtian Legion, the Armie of the Pagan Emperour being enuironed by the <hi>Quadi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> being preſently like to periſh for want of water, obteyned a plentifull ſhowre from heauen: while the hoſte of their enemies periſhed, being ſtricken with thundring and lightning from heauen: whereupon it was called the thundring Legion of the Chriſtians. And when as the witneſſes of God being ſo vnworthily and cruelly dealt withall, threaten eternall fire vpon the wicked Gentiles, and did perhaps foretell that fire ſhould come from heauen, whereby Cities and Camps were deuoured, may they not be ſaid after a ſort to caſt out fire out of their mouthes, to conſume their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? And when as Gods cruell enemies the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, did deſtroy one another by mutuall warre, and committed ſuch maſſacres by ſea and land, that they ſeemed to turne whole fields and riuers into blood, might not God ſeeme according to the Prophecie, moſt iuſtly to haue reuenged the wrongs of his witneſſes? eſpecially when he raiſed other witneſſes, as <hi>Phenixes</hi> out of their aſhes, who ſhould beare witnes to the truth.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15182:68"/> and ſo Gods two witneſſes in ſingular perſons, may ſeeme to riſe againe in a ſucceſſion. And becauſe not onely the triumphant Church, but the militant alſo is often called heauen, both in the Apocalyps,<note place="margin">The Church called heauen.</note> and in the Scripture elſewhere, therefore when the witneſſes of God had built againe the Temple of God out of theſe ruines and reliques, ſo, as the Prophet ſpeaketh: they ſeemed to aſcend vp, and to bee in beauen. But if any thinke it conuenient to expound this place of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Antichriſt, which did liuely expreſſe the cruelty of the firſt Beaſt, and of thoſe Antichriſtians, which did moſt cruelly perſecute the Church in theſe latter ages, for the ſpace of 494. yeeres, I will not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtriue againſt them: when <hi>as they did play the Gentiles vnder the name of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh. Onely I ſhew what other learned men haue probably thought, without preiudice to them that thinke otherwiſe. But all that I haue ſayd, is refuted of the Aduerſaries in 3. words: for thus they cry out, Antichriſt is not yet come: and they call all things to queſtion, whether there be Antichriſt, which if you pleaſe we ſtill diſcuſſe in the laſt place.</p>

Verſ. 2.</note> it ſhould come to paſſe that the city and the Temple ſhould bee vtterly ouerthrowen, ſo that a ſtone ſhould not bee left vpon a ſtone, Firſt, I ſay, anſwers them about the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Ieruſalem, which they thought ſhould haue ſtood for euer. They asking him,<note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> Tell vs when theſe things ſhall be? that is, when ſhall the Temple bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and afterward they aske him of the end of the world, and of his comming to iudgement. The parts of the queſtion are therefore double, firſt of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Ieruſalem, the ſecond of the end of the world: which they thought ſhould not continue longer then Ieruſalem. To the firſt Chriſt anſwers firſt from ver. 4.<note place="margin">Verſ. 4. to 23.</note> to the 23. To the ſecond he anſwers from the 23.<note place="margin">Ver. 23. to the 42.</note> to the 42. And firſt Chriſt fore-ſheweth the calamities which went before the deſtruction, to the fifteenth verſe, in that verſe hee expounds the deſtruction fore-tolde by <hi>Daniel.</hi> But if any body thinke that the abomination of deſolation, ſtanding in the holy place, be to be taken by an anologie for the ſitting of Antichriſt in the Church, I will not gaine ſay it; but if hee expound it properly, and to the lettter, hee ſhall not haue onely <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> but Chriſt himſelfe gaine-ſaying him. Among other calamities which were before the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, he fore-ſhewed two ſpirituall ones eſpecially: a ſeducing of falſe Prophets, a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people. Chriſt doth therefore forewarne and comfort his Diſciples: hee forewarneth them that they beware of falſe Prophets: hee comforts them with a double promiſe, one of eternall ſaluation verſ. 13.<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> if
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15182:70"/> they ſhall hold out to the end: another of a proſperous ſucceſſe, which their miniſtery by ſpreading the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ouer all the world, ſhall haue before Ieruſalem be vtterly ouerthrowen. That it might be a witneſſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery nation, that the Church ſhall endure when Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſhall bee deſtroyed, whoſe bounds the Apoſtles and their Diſciples by the preaching of the Goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of Ieruſalem had extended ouer all nations, both Gentiles and Iewes. Neither is it to bee thought, that Chriſt had confounded all theſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the handling of them, that he might not nouriſh an errour, which the Diſciples had conceiued of the continuance of Ieruſalem till the end of the world. Therefore after hee had verſ. 15.<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> deſcribed her ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, he adioyned both counſell and comfort: coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell the ver. 16.<note place="margin">Verſ. 16.17.18.19.20.</note> 17.18.19.20. that they that were in Iury ſhould ſhift for themſelues by ſpeedy flight, and that women great with childe ſhould pray that their flight bee not in the winter, or on the Sabbaoth day.

This expoſition of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirmed by the collation of <hi>Luke</hi> with <hi>Matthew.</hi> For as in Matth. 24.15. Chriſt doth propound thoſe words out of <hi>Daniel.</hi> When you ſhall ſee the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſolation (which <hi>Daniel</hi> cals the abominable wings deſolating) to ſtand in the holy place, Luc. cap. 21. 20. expounds it thus.

Yet by the whole world, euery little and obſcure corner of the world is not meant, but the greateſt part of the knowen and habitable world, Luc. 2.1. Neither by all nations, are ment all ſeueral nations, but all in generall, that is, both Iewes an Gentiles. For in this place as elſewhere, there is an oppoſition betweene all Nations and the Iewes. At that time the Goſpell was onely heard of in Iury, wherein the Church at that time was encloſed; but the partition-wall being broken downe, and the hedge being broken vp, it made ſuch a ſound euery way, with ſuch a number of Preachers, and with ſuch admirable efficacy of preaching, that it is eaſie to be beleeued that the ſound of the Goſpell could goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all lands within the compaſſe of forty yeeres, for ſo many yeeres at the leaſt, came betweene the propheſie expounded and fulfilled. Laſtly, although it was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to all, it was not receiued of all, therefore left as a teſtimony to all nations, that being offered to all, and reiected of ſome, it might make them inexcuſable. Doe you not ſee the fooliſh conſequence of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> propoſition, and the apparant vntruth of his aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Therfore I do retort the argument vpon him thus, Chriſt himſelfe propheſying, <hi>Paul</hi> interpreting, and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> aſſiſting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But the Antecedent is true. Therefore the conſequent is true.</hi>

               <p>Let vs ſee the ſtrength and ſinewes of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull demonſtration, wherin they ſo greatly triumph, although in opening of the prophecy, it is ſufficiently before refuted, the aſſumption whereof they go about to ſtrengthen on euery ſide. This is the aſſumption. <hi>But the Romaine Empire is not yet vtterly ouerturned, ſo that it hath loſt the name of the Romane Empire.</hi> Which they proue <hi>becauſe the Romane Empire is to be diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tenne Kings whereof none is called the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi> They endeauour to ſtrengthen either part out of the 2.<note place="margin">Daniel 2.32.</note> and ſeuenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and 17. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> in the 2. of <hi>Daniel</hi> they ſay <hi>is deſcribed a ſucceſſion of</hi> 4. <hi>Kingdomes to laſt vnto the worlds end, by the Image, hauing the head of gold, the breſt of ſiluer, the belly of braſſe, and the feete of iron. The head of braſſe ſignifieth</hi> ſay they <hi>the Kingdome of the Chaldees, the breſt of ſiluer the Kingdome of the Perſians, the belly of braſſe the Kingdome of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Grecians, the feete of braſſe the Kingdome of the Romanes: the</hi> 2. <hi>feete the eaſterne and the weſterne Empire of the Romanes:</hi> Now <hi>as</hi> 2. <hi>feet haue</hi> 10. <hi>toes,</hi> ſay they, <hi>which are not feete: So the Romane Empire ſhall bee diuided into</hi> 10. <hi>Kings, whereof none is, or is called the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15182:72"/> The very ſame</hi> 4. <hi>Kingdomes</hi> Dan. 7. <hi>are deſcribed by</hi> 4. <hi>beaſtes, a Lyon, a beare, a Leopard, and a fourth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name hauing</hi> 10. <hi>hornes, whereof none is, or is called a beaſt. But this beaſt</hi> they ſay ſignifieth <hi>the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the</hi> 10. <hi>hornes</hi> 10. <hi>Kings which ſhall diuide that Empire. Which they proue out of the</hi> 17. <hi>of the</hi> Apocalips, <hi>where</hi> Iohn <hi>deſcribes the beaſt with ſeauen heades and</hi> 10. <hi>hornes vpon whom the woman ſate.</hi> For the Angell ſay they doth ſo interpret. <hi>The woman is a great city which ſitteth vpon</hi> 7. <hi>hills, that is Rome. The</hi> 10. <hi>hornes are</hi> 10. <hi>Kings which ſhall raigne at one time, and ſhall hate the whore &amp;c. By which wordes the Angell doth ſignifie that the Romane Empire by them ſhall be diuided and deſolated, ſo that it ſhall not retaine the name of the Romane Empire.</hi> But that Antichriſt is not as yet to come, it is openly euic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Daniel</hi> cap 7. verſ: 14. the ten hornes are the tenne Kings of that kingdome, whereof wee haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hitherto. <hi>And another</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſhall riſe after them,</hi>

                  <hi>(to wit Antichriſt) and he ſhall be more potent then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſhall ſubdue three Kings, and hee ſhall vtter ſpeech againſt the moſt higheſt, and ſhal tread vnder foote the Saints of the Almightie, and ſhall imagine that he can change times and lawes, and they ſhall bee deliuered into his handes for a time, times and halfe a time.</hi> And this they proue out of <hi>Hirom.</hi> who addeth, <hi>that a leuenth little King ſhal ariſe, who ſhall ouercome three of the tenne Kings.</hi> Yea <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> goeth farther, and out of the 11. Chapter verſ: 21. and <hi>in his place ſhall ſtand vp the moſt vile, concludeth that Antichriſt riſing out of a baſe place ſhall by fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit get the Kingdome of the Iewes, and ſhall not ſight onely with three Kings of Egypt, Libia, and Ethiopia, and ſhall enioy their Kingdomes themſelues being vanquiſhed, but ſhal alſo make ſlaues ſeauen other Kings, and ſhall haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the whole world</hi> 3. <hi>yeares and a halfe: and in the meane time ſhall oppreſſe the Chriſtians with an innumerable armie, and theſe are the warres of Gog and Magog.</hi> By all which prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15182:73"/> Romane Empire and Antichriſt, together with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Kingdome, beginning, end, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, all (as he thinkes) ſo fitly agreeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues, hee peremptorily concludeth that Antichriſt is not yet come. Whereby there is a greater charge neceſſarily impoſed vpon vs to looke diligently to the expounding of <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie, as wee were carefull formerly of expounding of <hi>Iohns</hi> prophecie: So the argument ſhal be well ſatisfied, when I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the hiſtorie with the prophecie, and ſet in order things confuſed, and make plaine thinges obſcure, and ſhall compare Teſtament with Teſtament, booke with booke, chapter with chapter, verſe with verſe; neither will I adde a long Commentarie to a cleare text, nor too ſhort a Commentarie to an obſcure, by this meanes I ſhall neither admit ſuperfluities, or omit neceſſaries. Eſpecially when the prophecie is as a riddle which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkely in many wordes ſet downe by the Prophet cannot be made plaine in a few wordes by a Doctour, which doth rather require a Prophet to be the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till euent hath made it plaine. Wherein the Papiſts (but chiefly <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) muſt deale more fauourably with vs, who hath reiected 12. Fathers in this cauſe, if we likewiſe doe reiect the ſame, and among them <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> chiefly, ſo it be without touch of his reputation, ſeeing <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith that prophecies may ſooner bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed then vnderſtood, and doth ſometime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that naked authorities being laid aſide, the matter with the matter, and the cauſe with the cauſe, and the reaſon may ſtriue with the reaſon. <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaith that prophecies till they bee performed are to bee counted doubtfull riddles:<note place="margin">Irene lib. <hi>4.</hi> ad ver. hereſ. c. <hi>43.</hi>
                  </note> wherein <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhall not grant leſſe to vs, then he taketh to himſelfe, who when hee ſeeth his Maſter the Pope to bee pincht and ſtonge by <hi>Ireneus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de Pon: lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> makes this anſwere to ſerue his turne. <hi>Ireneus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thinkes it a ſurer way and leſſe dangerous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the fulfilling of the prophecie, then to ſuſpect it.</hi> And the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15182:73"/> Papiſts ſeeme to haue learned this modeſtie out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> who prophecing of other things as wee ſhall proue, of Antichriſt as the Papiſts thinke, ſay that the words are ſhut and ſealed vp to the time appointed. Who if we grant to haue foretould of the Romane Empire and of Antichriſt, he will neither much hurt our cauſe or helpe theirs. For if <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth beaſt be the ſtate of the Romane Empire, and the 10. hornes the tenne Kings among whom it ſhall bee diuided, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth horne ſpringing thence be Antichriſt, aſſuredly the Pope who is raiſed out of the fall and ruine of the Empire, is Antichriſt. Here if you pleaſe I will conſider of all thoſe places alleaged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and ſearch-out how they agree within themſelues and how with the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the fourth Empire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellarmines contradiction.</note> 
                  <hi>which he taketh to be the Romane, ſhall laſt to the worlds end.</hi> And yet hee ſaith <hi>that the Romane Empire, ſhall be vtterly deſtroied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Antichriſt, who ſhall raigne three yeares and a halfe.</hi> How can hee then alleage it for a truth that the Romane Empire ſhall laſt to the worlds end? I ſend this great <hi>Chriſippus</hi> againe to <hi>Ariſtotles Analytickes,</hi> whither ſome time he ſendeth others without cauſe, that when he hath reuiewed them he may teach vs how two contradictions can be true at one time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Romane Empire ſhall laſt to the worlds end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Romane Empire ſhall not laſt to the worlds end,</hi> for it muſt haue the finall deſtruction at the comming of Antichriſt, who ſhall raigne three yeares and a halfe. Now let vs conſider how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Many of our age and thoſe very learned, who ſeeme very exactly to ſearch into <hi>Daniel,</hi> do thinke that the fourth Empire (which many other without doubt as well learned as they doe take for the Romane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie) was the Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucides</hi> and the <hi>Lagides</hi> in <hi>Siria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 7. of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </note> as they afflicted <hi>Iury</hi> hembd in betweene them: and therefore deſigned to be more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15182:74"/> terrible then the three former, becauſe more dangerous to <hi>Iury.</hi> And that the <hi>ten hornes were ten Kings of Siria &amp; Egypt, who did ſucceſſiuely oppreſſe the Iewes, and that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes was the tenth and laſt, who more then the reſt did plague them moſt cruelly, and that therefore he was the type of Antichriſt who ſhould no leſſe afflict the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and not Antichriſt himſelfe,</hi> as Bellarmine dreameth. Let vs if you pleaſe alledge ſome of the reaſons drawne out of the Text.</p>

Macc. 9.</note>If Antichriſt be in all things <hi>Antiochus,</hi> certainely as <hi>Antiochus</hi> is dead, as it is in the end of the chapter, ſo Antichriſt is dead. Then Antichriſt muſt die before his birth: but by what kinde of death <hi>Antiochus</hi> died, is declared. Lice did crawle out of his ſwolne bodie in great abundance, which did inwardly gnaw vpon him, heereby his fleſh putrified,<note place="margin">Wherein <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> and Antichriſt diſagree.</note> and fell from him by peece-meales, ſo that the army could not endure the ſtinch of the beaſt.

               </p>
               <p>If Antichriſt ſhall get the ſame kingdome of the Iewes, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> enioyed: if he ſhall caſt down and root out three hornes, that is, three kings next go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before in the kingdome of Syria, the father, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the nephew, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> did to get his fathers kingdome by deceit: therefore theſe three muſt bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, after they bee dead, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> the father, and <hi>Seleucus</hi> the brother, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the nephew, muſt riſe againe before the reſurrection, that Antichriſt may depriue them of their kingdome, and by his cunning caſt them off and deſtroy them. This is the ſumme of my concluſion. Antichriſt is <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his identity, or in his likeneſſe: if in his identity, it is a great miracle: if in his likeneſſe, it is a lame argument: for euery ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude doth halt, as the Logicians teach, and a ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical argument is not of force to argue, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith. Yet notwithſtanding rather for a flouriſh, then for a proofe of the cauſe let vs ſhortly ſee wherein Antichriſt is like or diſlike vnto <hi>Antiochus. Antiochus</hi> came not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15182:77"/> out of a baſe ſtocke and kindred, as many Popes did, but out of a kingly race. Antichriſt is the ſonne of the earth, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs. <hi>Antiochus</hi> moſt abiect in his manners, but of a great parentage, but is farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Prophet to bee by his country a Syrian, by religion vncircumciſed, a breaker of the ſabboth, an oppreſſour of the Iewes, a worſhipper of <hi>Iupiter Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius.</hi> What Antichriſt? how is he painted out by you? Is he not though baſe in minde, yet baſer by birth, by country a Iew, by religion circumciſed, a keeper of the Sabbaoth, the Meſſias of the Iewes, an enemy to Idols, is he not thus deſcribed? that he may well enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie himſelfe to be <hi>Antiochus,</hi> though hee be hanged vp in his picture. You ſee how vnlike, now marke how like he is to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> For I will neuer denie that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> in many things is the type of Antichriſt. Nay, I will ſay more,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> the type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, wherin they do agree.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things out of <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſies into their owne, wherewith they did liuely ſet out and expreſſe that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. <hi>Antiochus</hi> is an enemy to God, and aduerſary to the Church, lifting vp himſelfe aboue all, &amp; againſt all that is called God, an Out-law, whoſe will ſtands for a law, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh great things, whoſe hands doe afflict Gods Saints, ſuch an one is Antichriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Apoſtles. <hi>Antiochus</hi> as hee did abrogate his country and falſe ceremonies, ſo the Iewiſh and the true ceremonies. Antichriſt hath ouerthrowen the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of the Gentiles, and hath altered the true and Chriſtian worſhip of God. <hi>Antiochus</hi> is inwardly an Atheiſt, and outwardly an Idolater: for he did worſhip <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> in the Temple of Ieruſalem, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed others to worſhip him, whom their fore-fathers worſhipped not, who had worſhipped <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> So Antichriſt is an inward Atheiſt, and an outward Idolater. <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſhall worſhip in his place the god <hi>Maozim</hi> deſcribed verſ. 38. as it is in the vulgar tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So Antichriſt alſo, <hi>who ſhall worſhip the Diuell, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15182:78"/> the author of his ſtrength and power, hee ſhall worſhip the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell againſt God,</hi> as your interlined gloſſe hath it. And <hi>Bellarmine, He ſhall worſhip the Diuell after the manner of the Magicians, but cloſely. And this is called the god Mao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim, by whoſe helpe Antichriſt ſhall worke miracles.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt therefore ſhall be an idolater by his owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which elſewhere he often denieth.

How then ſhall hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Diuell, as he writ before? you ſee that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is like to <hi>Antiochus</hi> in many things, I grant then that Antichriſt is typically deſcribed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> but not prophetically,<note place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi> de Antichr.</note> whom euen <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants to haue ſpoken literally of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when hee ſeeth that the Pope is ſo neerely vrged and ſtung by our men with theſe notes of likeneſſe.

For as two feete, haue ten toes, which are not feete, and as the ten hornes are not the beaſt, ſo the Romane Empire ſhall be diuided into ten Kings whereof none is the King of the Romanes. O full wittily as hee thinkes. But <hi>Daniels</hi> two feete are not the <hi>eſterne and weſterne</hi> Empires of Rome, but <hi>Ptolomeus Lagis,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus Nicauor, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders Princes</hi> as I ſaid before: And the ten hornes of the beaſt are not ten Kings riſing out of the ruine of the Romane Empire, but ten <hi>Seleucides,</hi> as toes ſpringing out of thoſe feete, after the deſtruction of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Empire, whence foure hornes aroſe in <hi>Alexanders</hi> place, as I ſhewed before, which fell afterward to bee two feete.

I grant it. Neither ſo ſhall I looſe the cauſe But that is not ſet downe by <hi>Iohn</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth, <hi>whereof none is, or is called the King of the Romanes.</hi> The cleane contrary is ſet downe by <hi>Iohn</hi> as I prooued before. As the Romane Empire was to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15182:80"/> taken away as <hi>Paul</hi> taught,<note place="margin">Why the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire reſtored.</note> ſo farre forth, as it hindered the reuealing and gouernment of Antichriſt: So a new Empire as the picture of the old was to bee reſtored of the land-beaſt chap. 13. i. of Antichriſt that the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> might ſit vpon her backe chap. 17. One of the two heades of the ſea-beaſt, <hi>i.</hi> the weſterne Empire of Rome, dead in <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> reuiued in <hi>Charles</hi> by the land-beaſt, that is Antichriſt, got life againe and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſtrength, and therefore it was not finally ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. The image of the firſt beaſt recouered life, and voice: and therefore did not altogether looſe her power and name. The image of the old Empire got life againe, the name remained: the thing it ſelfe periſhed not, but paſt ouer from the chiefe ſecular Prince, to the chiefe ſpirituall prince: as <hi>Aquinas</hi> teacheth. So as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt was the laſt ſtate, that held the Romane Empire, without the name of the Romane Emperour</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth. Therefore the Pope did transfer the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and the power of the Romane Empire to himſelfe and hath left a bare name and title to the Emperour, that the Emperour might be like him.<note place="margin">The power of the Empire in the Pope, the name in the Emperour.</note> A Biſhoppe in name, and an Emperour in name. Indeed the Biſhop infringeth the faith of Chriſt, profeſſeth his name, and ſeemes his Vicegerent. A ſubſtitute in name, but a reall Aduerſarie. So the maieſtie of the Emperour reſides in the Pope, the title in the Emperour. Then the titulare Emperour is the Popes reall vaſſall. Let him be called, and you will the King of the Romanes, to whom the Pope hath not left one foote of land in all <hi>Italie.</hi> So that the old Romane Empire in ſubſtance and power, is ſo diuided betweene the Kings and the beaſt, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, vnleſſe happily you would haue the Empire conſiſt, not in the number of landes, but of ſillables.

               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt ſigne that doth accompanie the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not only the preaching of Enoch and Elias, but their combate with Antichriſt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To proue the truth of all theſe paſſages <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath miſreported diuers teſtimonies out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fathers, all which the moſt excellent and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King of great Britaine hath ſo wreſted out of the hands of the ſilly weake Doctour, that in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all learned men hee ſeemes to haue wonne the cauſe.

All godly learned men will grant, that theſe two holy Prophets, for their ſingulare holineſſe had an eſpeciall priuiledge from God: when one of them,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> that is <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, that <hi>he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> the other <hi>was taken vp in a fiery chariot into Heauen.</hi> Let me therefore aske <hi>Bellarmine</hi> certaine queſtions for my learning, that I may ſearch out the truth of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, not only for the refuting of the fable, but for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of the Church.<note place="margin">The firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> Firſt therefore I demand where <hi>Enoch and Elias</hi> be at this preſent? <hi>Bellarmine anſweres and that confidently; in Paradiſe.</hi> What? are they in that Paradiſe,<note place="margin">A diſcourſe of Paradiſe.</note> wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was placed at the firſt, which <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes to be planted by God in the region of <hi>Eden,</hi> a place ſo full of delights, watered with a great riuer from whence foure other great and noble riuers did flow?

That wee may grant that Paradiſe is as well planted and delightſome a place, as euer it was, wherein with the ſmell of flowers and fruit, the ſweetneſſe of fountaines, the greeneſſe of the fields, the chanting of birds, the melodie in the woodes, the ſhadow of trees they might delight themſelues ſo many ages. Yet for all that, Paradiſe could not be ſo pleaſing vnto them, that it could content them for the loſſe of one day, wherein they were depriued of heauen.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> corrupted.</note> For whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proues out of the Apocryphal ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> that <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, he had ſaid ſomewhat if Paradiſe had not beene foiſted into the Apocryphall text: for though it bee in the Latine vulgare tranſlation, yet it is not in the Greek originall. But what will hee anſwere for <hi>Elias,</hi> whom the canonicall Scripture doth plainly ſet downe to bee taken vp into heauen, not as it were into heauen, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen it ſelfe? He cannot denie that which many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Papiſts do grant, that God in the Scripture did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his decree concerning <hi>Elias</hi> in uery plaine wordes, vnleſſe happily in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion when God had determined to take <hi>Elias</hi> vp into heauen, he ſuddainly changed his minde, and caſt him into Paradiſe? <hi>Elias</hi> therefore doth ſo much the more greeuouſly take the loſſe of heauen, as he was neere enioying of it,<note place="margin">Paradiſe taken away.</note> and miſt it. But if Paradiſe which was ſometime a moſt pleaſant and delightſome place, hath beene a long time ſince ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, what comfort then is left to <hi>Enoch and Elias</hi> wherewith they might comfort themſelues for the want of heauen? Now to let paſſe other Papiſts, <hi>Pererius</hi> the Ieſuite doth in many wordes proue, that Paradiſe was ouerflowne with the flood, and grew ſo wilde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, that although it was a place, yet it left off
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15182:82"/> to be a Paradiſe.<note place="margin">Paradiſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowne with the flood.</note> But this vnieſuited <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that he might preſerue that place free from the inundation of waters, to be more pleaſant and wholeſome for <hi>Enoch and Elias,</hi> hath remooued it into a place neere the circle of the Moone.<note place="margin">Paradiſe not neere the Moone.</note> But the <hi>Ieſuite Pererius</hi> doth proue that it is the more incommodious, and vnholeſome, and altogither inhabitable. Firſt for the neereneſſe of the Sunne and other ſtarres, then for the Element of fire placed next the moone, beſides for the perpetuall agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place, being carried ſwiftly about with the conſtant motion of the heauen. So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath prouided very ill for thoſe good Fathers, when he placed Paradiſe ſo neere the Moone, &amp; hath done great wrong to the Inhabitants of the earth, as <hi>Pererius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth pretily and pleaſantly, that the height of Paradiſe, being in a place oppoſite to the eaſt, would keepe away the light of the Sunne. It is good ſport to ſee theſe two learned Ieſuits wrangling together about the ſcituation of Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Papiſt againſt Papiſt.</note> as the <hi>Madianites</hi> wounding one another with their mutuall blowes. Yet out of this their conflict the truth doth appeare that <hi>Enoch and Elias</hi> is not in the earthly Paradiſe. And yet without all doubt they muſt be in Paradiſe, then in heauenly Paradiſe Which when all is done he confeſſeth they bee not in the ethereall, but aeriall heauen. Aeriall Doctour, who dreames that God will giue, but an aeriall happineſſe to theſe his excellent Prophets. For whereas he thinkes it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion for any to confeſſe, that heauen gates were open for any before Chriſt, and to the proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath gathered, and bent all his forces, that moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Byſhoppe of <hi>Elie</hi> hath ſo weakened and diſperſt them, that he hath cleane vanquiſhed the Sophiſter and driuen him out of the field. <q>
                     <hi>Enoch and Elias are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſonne of man: the ſonne did firſt aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his owne power: Enoch and Elias being members of Chriſt haue aſcended by the power of the ſonne of man, ſo that Chriſt may bee rightly ſaid to tread the way before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15182:82"/> them both.</hi>
                  </q> Whence ſeeing it ſufficiently appeares that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> doe now liue in heauen; I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand againe,<note place="margin">The ſecond Queſtion.</note> whether they entred heauen in their ſoules alone, or with their bodies alſo? For if onely in their ſoules, as certaine learned men doe thinke, they muſt twiſe riſe againe, if it be true that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, once to fight againſt Antichriſt; the ſecond time, to conuert the Iewes to Chriſt. If with their bodies alſo, which the greater ſort, and better learned on both ſides do conclude, that they may not deny the priuilege giuen to them for our comfort, I will not curiouſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether they enioy the bleſſed viſion of God, when I heare they be entred into the houſe of God, that is, the heauens, wherein Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>he hath many manſion places.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Of the looſing and binding of Sathan.</head>
               <p>THe comming of Antichriſt doth goe before the looſing of Sathan, who appeareth by the premiſſes, to be not onely borne and of ſome yeeres, but being of a ripe and ſetled age gouerned vnder the figure of the beaſt cap: 13. ſo furious that he ſlew them that refuſed to worſhip the image of the beaſt, his ſynagogue was deſcribed vnder the type of the whore, making the Princes of the earth drunke with the golden cup of her fornication, and her ſelfe made drunke with the blood of the Saints. I adde alſo out of the conſequents: for the Angell, (by whom Satan is ſaid to be bound for a thouſand yeeres, after the end of thoſe yeeres to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a ſmall time v: 2. &amp; 3. of which ſmall time there is mention made cap: 12.) reciteth that hee ſaw their ſoules, who were killed for the teſtimonie of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would neither worſhip the image of the beaſt, nor take his marke vpon them, v: 4. &amp; 5. But for the clearer vnderſtanding of this obſcure place, I muſt firſt ſpeake of ſome few diſtinctions taken out of the Text, that thereby the vanitie of this demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be laid open to euery mans view.<note place="margin">The expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place of the looſing and binding of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> Twiſe Satan is ſaid to be bound, twiſe to be looſed: firſt bound by Chriſt, that he might not deſtroy the ſoule of any of the faithfull: but looſed to afflict the fleſh. Bound for euer, that by his ſpirituall tricks hee might not ouerthrow the ſaluation of the Church: but looſe for a time, that with bodily plagues he might exerciſe their patience. Here I diſtinguiſh the time, from which he was bound, from the time wherein hee was twiſe looſed. Once from the beheading of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> to the Empire of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> againe from the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the Empire of <hi>Ottoman</hi> the firſt,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15182:85"/> and the Popedome of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. Hee was looſed from the death of the <hi>Baptist</hi> almoſt 300 yeeres, that he might rage in the Romane Emperours againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church to the Empire of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> when hee was bound againe with the Angells chaine for a 1000. yeeres v: 2. cap: 20. He was againe let looſe that hee might rage for a litle while v: 3. as before almoſt three hundred yeeres in the <hi>Turkiſh Emperors,</hi> and the <hi>Rom: Biſhops,</hi> from <hi>Ottoman</hi> the firſt, and from <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8; whereof, he without, this within, 1300 yeeres from the death of Chriſt, 1000 from the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> began cruelly to rage againſt the Church, one in the Eaſt, the other in the Weſt. There are who number the beginning of the 1000 yeeres from the yeere of Chriſt 73. wherein Ieruſalem being defaced, Satan cap: 12. did endeuour to put out the Church diſperſed among the Gentiles: the ſeede of the woman, which fled into the wildernes for a ſhort time, that is, a time, times, and halfe a time: which ſpace doth well anſwer 42 monthes, and 1260 daies, as the learned teach, which according to the ſupputation of <hi>Daniel,</hi> doe make two hundred ninetie and foure yeeres. In which time the Dragon, as is ſaid, being angry with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did goe about to deſtroy the reſt of the womans ſeed that remained. Now in the 20. chapter, where the ſame hiſtorie is thought to be continued, the Angell is ſaid to haue bound Sathan with a chaine for a thouſand yeeres, which was ended in the yeere 1703. at what time Satan is vnderſtood to be looſed in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gregor:</hi> 7.</note> in whom Antichriſt as a ſtrong man began to ſtriue againſt the Empire.<note place="margin">Difference about the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Satan.</note> But they ſeeme more rightly to interpret this place, who thinke that Satan bound for a thouſand yeeres was let looſe, at the riuer <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the outward enemie of the Church <hi>Ottoman,</hi> the firſt Emperor of the Turkes, and his poſteritie the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous enemies of the Chriſtian name, in whom the prophecie of Gog and Magog is thought to be fulfilled.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:15182:86"/> Vnleſſe they be rather to be beleeued, who vnderſtand the place not of the Turke only, nor of the Pope only, but of them both; counting, as I ſaid, the ſecond loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Satan, from the raigne of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> wherein he was bound for a 1000 yeeres, to the raigne of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and the Popedome of <hi>Boniface,</hi> wherein hee was looſed after that bloody decree of the counſell of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane, about the burning of Gods ſeruants, termed by them Heretikes, which hath moſt cruelly deuoured and conſumed many millions of innocent men tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a lingring death, who referre the place to Antichriſt only, doe ſhrewdly gale <hi>Bellarmines</hi> maſter, who referre it to the Turke only, doe take away <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> demonſtration.

                     </gap>es erected for crueltie.</note> when both performe the ſame, they erect two ſtages, one at Conſtantinople, thother at Rome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee may ſee a blacke Diuell furiouſly raging in the one, and a white Diuell in the other. For whereas it is certaine, that the Saracens without, and Antichriſt within, did bring many plagues vpon the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of that 1000 yeeres, and did ſtirre vp many miſchiefes, and many garboyles within the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Church, Satan being the leader, and the Pope the author: Firſt I ſay that the inuaſion of the outward enemies neither was ſo generall, nor ſo continuall; nor the perſecution of the inward enemies, although it was raiſed vp often for the ſhew of religion, not ſo often for the cauſe of religion, as for a greedy humor to gouerne: that the Church might feele rather the outward peace to be intermitted, then quite omitted, and that Satans chaine did ſeeme rather to be ſomewhat ſlackned by the Angell, rather then altogether looſned. For Satan did rather nouriſh and increaſe Antichriſt his darling and ſweet heart with outward peace then warre: flattering the world rather then threatning it; bound rather then looſe: ſo that in compariſon of thoſe continuall inuaſions of Turkes, and the perpetuall perſecutions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15182:86"/> of Popes, wherwith the whole Eaſt and Weſt Churches haue bin moſt miſerably torne in pieces theſe 300 yeers The outward peace may ſeeme to bee giuen to the Church, as a breathing time for a thouſand yeeres, but yet ſuch as the Church may cry out with <hi>Eſay,</hi> behold <hi>in peace my bitterneſſe is moſt bitter:</hi> for by thoſe meanes whereby Sathan did grant an outward peace to the Church, by the ſame hee aſſayed to take away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: being very carefull to yeeld to the Pope his gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full merchandize of ſoules, while hee ſolde ſinnes,<note place="margin">Sathan did more hurt bound then looſe.</note> as it were, by the drumme in the Temple at the higheſt rate; and did racke and gather together great treaſures to his companion, compaſt him with pleaſures and got him all authority, all which he could not haue effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without long peace. Sathan therfore was bound,<note place="margin">☜</note> not that hee ſhould not at all ſtirre againſt the Church, but that he might doe it more mildly, and for his owne good: that hee might ſeeme rather to play then rage in his chaine, and to play not the cut-throat, but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zener; and might rather infect men then kill them, and might not maſſacre them with murthers, but deceiue them with lies, and ſhew himſelfe more a Comedian then a Tragedian, and deceiue the world more with ſweete baites, then mingle any ſower, vnleſſe it were when he went about to get his eldeſt ſonne the Empire, then he is ſayd to play the Tragicomedian. So Sathan being bound did doe more good to Antichriſt, then if he had beene looſe: yea, rather he loſt that being looſe, that hee got being bound. For whom Antichriſt long held blinded with ſuperſtition, and deceiued with the enticements of peace, thoſe he did after ſo ſtir vp, worne out with warres, and diſcontented with perſecutions, that they at laſt rebelled againſt him, and did very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly defend the oppreſſed cauſe of the Goſpell. Now that I haue ſhortly expounded the place of Sathans looſing, let vs returne to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument, who prooues out of this place, that the moſt greeuous perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15182:87"/> that euer was, ſhall be vnder Antichriſt, which if it touch the Turke onely, it taketh away the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> demonſtration, if it preſſe the Pope, the argument is brought vpon the authors head. For the moſt greeuous perſecution whereof he ſpeaketh, is come already. And therefore Antichriſt is come. Adde that this comes neerer the Pope then hee is aware. For</p>
               <p>The inward moſt greeuous perſecuter of the Church is Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>The Pope is the moſt greeuous inward perſecuter of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Pope therefore is Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Antichriſts perſecution muſt be moſt notorious</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>The Popes perſecution is not moſt notorious: why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the wicked would oppugne the Church with open warre, and not onely infidels and knowen ſinners, but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and falſe brethren would ioyne themſelues to the Pope, and laying themſelues open, would openly inuade the Church. For ſuch perſecution becommeth Antichrist, the Pope it becommeth not.</hi> And why? <hi>becauſe there bee ſo many hypocrites and falſe brethren in the Church, hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Romane.</hi> I grant it, it is a defence full of truth. The Pope that great hypocrite,<note place="margin">The Pope that great hypocrite.</note> muſt needes beget ſons like himſelfe, arrant hypocrites and diſſemblers. But I feare I may not grant him that, where hee ſaith, that hypocrites and ſyncere Chriſtians, whom as chaffe and wheat, Chriſt ſaith, are not to bee diuided before the day of his comming, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmes that they are to be ſeparated before the comming of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Hence thus I diſpute.</p>
               <p>When all hypocrites ſhall be made knowen, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall come.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt commeth all hypocrites ſhall bee made knowen.</p>
               <p>Therfore when Chriſt commeth, Antichriſt ſhall come.</p>
               <p>Therefore Antichriſt ſhall bee not a beaſt of three
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15182:87"/> yeere olde, but a beaſt of a day olde: vnleſſe he thinke that Antichriſt ſhall come after the comming of Chriſt, and the end of the world: for that which hee addes in the end, that there ſhall bee ſuch a perſecution vnder Antichriſt, that all the publike ceremonies and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of religion ſhall ceaſe, is a meere dotage. He whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgets what is ſet downe by the Apoſtle, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be a notable hypocrite, not an outward, but an homebred enemy, who with fained holineſſe and ſanctity, ſhall entice and deceiue ſimple people, as <hi>Acoſta, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iega, Pererius, Ribera,</hi> foure principall Ieſuits doe plainely ſet downe: and by this meanes doe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken <hi>Bellarmines</hi> idle demonſtration. Which let vs waigh if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The publike worſhip of God, and the daily ſacrifice of Chriſtians vnder the perſecution of Antichriſt, ſhall ceaſe at that time when Antichriſt ſhall come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worſhip of God, and the ſacrifice of Chriſtians is not ceaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore as yet Antichriſt is not come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee prooues his popoſition out of the 12.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.5.11.</note> of <hi>Daniel</hi> verſ. 11. from that time, when the dayly ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, are 1290. daies: where <hi>Daniel,</hi>

The manner of the Iewes was to offer ſacrifice to God morning and euening, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſacrifice was taken away by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> and the author of the firſt booke of Macchabees, and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> plainely witneſſe. And to <hi>Daniel</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when the end of theſe euils ſhall be, God anſwers, from that time, <hi>When the daily ſacrifice ſhall bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the abomination of deſolation ſet vp,</hi> whereof hee

                  <note place="margin">Diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerance.</note> that there were diuers degrees noted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> at diuers times. For from the hinderance of the worſhip of God, to the firſt reſtoring of the ſame by <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, there were three yeeeres and tenne dayes: which ſpace chap. 7. verſ. 25. hee called a time, times, and a peece of time. To the victory of <hi>Iudas Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi> when hee draue <hi>Antiochus</hi> forces out of Iury, and ſo did eſtabliſh the firſt reſtitution, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, there was three yeeres and an halfe, which ſpace chap. 12. v. 7. he calleth a time, times, and halfe a time. To the time, wherein <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſtrucken by the hand of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would reſtore the Iewiſh religion, hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands there were 1290.<note place="margin">

I maruell the more that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was ſo blinde in the propheſie, and ſo ignorant in the hiſtory, that he dreameth that the publike worſhip of God, and ſacrifice of the Iewes, taken away by the moſt greeuous perſecution of <hi>Antiochus</hi> within three yeere and a halfe, ſhould bee the like publike worſhip of God, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Chriſtians, taken away by the perſecution of Antichriſt, three yeeres and a hafe before the end of the world. Hee confirmes the aſſumption by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which doth teſtifie that the publike worſhip of God was neuer taken away by the Pope, &amp; that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Chriſtians neuer ceaſed. He means the maſſe, and other publique voluntary worſhips of the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Church of Rome, which the Creede ſhall make plaine to be neither worſhip of God, nor the ſacrifice of Chriſtians. So the propoſition is fetcht out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture miſunderſtood, the aſſumption is the begging of the thing in queſtion. And is not this a worthy demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?</p>

               <p>This ſhall bee their euerlaſting argument while the world endureth, thus will they argue for Antichriſt: this becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought to be very abſurd, hee doth alter the queſtion and concludes thus. That it ſhall not be long before Antichriſt come. For
<q>If it were long before Antichriſt came, the end of the world would be long hence.</q> But the conſequence is falſe. Therfore the antecedent</p>
               <p>He proues his propoſition out of the Apoſtle. That Antichriſt ſhall come a little before the end of the world, and immediately before the ſecond comming of Chriſt, and then that ioyly fellow ſhall appeare, whom the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> ſhal conſume, with the ſpirit of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his comming. But the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh betweene the comming and the deſtruction of Antichriſt, betweene the ſubſtance of Antichriſt and his appearance or reuelation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which and his deſtruction there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

After he is reuealed, he ſaith hee ſhall waſt away by little and little with the ſpirit of the Lordes mouth, but ſhall bee vtterly put out by the brightneſſe of his comming.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> a prophane Ieſter.</note> Heere let me a little touch <hi>Bellarmines</hi> prophane ieſting.

As though there is not power in the word of God to weaken, and breake Antichriſt in peeces, the force whereof the beaſt ſhall feele in his fall and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now the thing is a working, now Chriſt doth enfeeble Antichriſt with his word, afterward hee ſhall deſtroy him with his preſence. Hee ſhall kill him by weakening him, that I may put off the Cardinals ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous diſtinction, who doth thus diſtinguiſh, <hi>Hee doth not ſay he ſhall weaken him but hee ſhall kill him.</hi> And it pleaſeth him to ſcoffe at vs when wee ſay that now Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be ouerthrowne by the word of the Lord,<note place="margin">☞</note> when as now the word of the Lord ſhall be ouerthrown by him. May not a Chriſtian, and an old man, and a Diuine bluſh for ſhame, (as for a Cardinall nothing will make him bluſh) to ſport and ieſt in a matter ſo weighty and ſerious? As God himſelfe ſo Gods word is eternall, his Miniſters Gods witneſſes Antichriſt could kill, the word it ſelfe he could neuer kill, which ſhall abide when he rots to nothing. Yea truely as the word of God is a liuing word ſo the Miniſters of the word Gods faithfull witneſſes being ſlaine, ſhall by the power of the word riſe againe, if not in their ſeuerall perſons, yet in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and kill this murthering Antichriſt. Chriſt therefore hath not a weake ſpirit, but the Cardinall hath a weake braine, who doth not as yet vnderſtand, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meanes which Chriſt vſeth in the aboliſhing of Antichriſt.

               <p>I Haue finiſhed the Glaſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, ſet before you to ſee your ſelfe, before others to look on themſelues, wherein Antichriſt is fully ſet downe as in preface. Heere you may ſee contained his right and true marks, the falſe being reiected and caſt by. Euery of them in ſeuerall, and all of them ioyntly together doe prooue the Pope to be that great Antichriſt. Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Popery is Antichriſtianity. What hee is, and who he is, appeares out of the preface. What he doth and what he teacheth, out of the Dialogue diuided into three bookes. Firſt comes vpon the ſtage Antichriſt pragmaticall. In the two other bookes Antichriſt dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall. There he carries himſelfe like a Rebell, heere like a Sophiſter: there he doth impaire the glory of the Empire, heere the truth of the Goſpell, there hee doth vndermine the faithfulneſſe of ſubiects, heere the faith of Chriſtians. The firſt booke doth propound the rules and grounds of Chriſtian fealty and obedience toward Kings againſt Chriſtian rebellion, ſhadowed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with a ſhew of Catholike religion. The other two doe erect the foundation and pillers of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith, againſt the Antichriſtian hereſie, compacted of twelue new articles of the faith, brought into the forme of a creede by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I call it the Popes creede. I doe ſolemnely profeſſe that I am afaithfull ſeruant of Chriſt and the King. I doe not take vpon me, being the meaneſt and the leaſt of all other, to giue warning vnto Kings, once already warned by the great King, not therefore to bee warned of any, but of Chriſt the King of Kings Let Ieſus Chriſt therefore bee in our thoughts a while, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be abſent in body, yet preſent in ſpirit, hath

               <p>I AM not ignorant, who am ignorant of nothing (ô yee Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi>) that the Byſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> my Vicare, as he calles himſelfe, my Aduerſarie,<note place="margin">The Pope both an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> as he carries himſelfe, hath beene a Teacher of hereſie in the Church, and a Practiſer of treaſon in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale for theſe many yeares. For euer ſince hee was made the vniuerſall Byſhop, he hath done nothing elſe, but corrupted my Goſpell, and peruerted your Empire. And no maruell, for out of the corruption of the Goſpell, doth follow the diſſolution of the Empire. For whereas I haue erected by the Goſpell a twofould pillar of gouernment, Authoritie in Magiſtrates, and Allegeance in Subiects; it is ſtrange to ſee the Goſpell peruerted in the mindes of men, how each pillar of gouernment falles to the grounds. The greateſt fault whereof is in the Byſhops treacherie, and in your ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that whereas I had ſubmitted all Byſhops vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your power and iudgement, you haue ſuffered one to fly out ſo farre aboue the reſt, that he dare not onely rebell againſt yours, but againſt my Maieſtie alſo. That therefore the ancient dignitie of the Empire, may be recouered being loſt, and for euer maintained being recouered; my counſell to you is, that the truth of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15182:97"/> Goſpell, ſhaken and long weakened, by the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, may at laſt be reſtored by your princely autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For what is more reaſonable, then that I ſhould haue you defenders of my glory, whom I haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters of my power? And if it were in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heretofore, whether that Byſhoppe, were that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; He is ſo prophetically deſcribed by my beloued Diſciples <hi>Iohn and Paul,</hi> that now it is out of queſtion, ſeeing that euent hath laid open and made cleare the prophecie. For all the partes of the prophecie are ſo plainely interpreted,<note place="margin">All notes of Antichriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Pope.</note> of the ſucceſſion of the perſons, the nature and diſpoſition of the King, and kingdome, the acts of the beaſt, the impreſſion of the Character, the number of his name, the ſcituation of his ſeate, the time of his reuealing, the cuppe of the whore, the kind of his marchandiſe, the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> laſtly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, and going out, the birth, and death of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the laſt anſwering the firſt, and the middle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering both, with ſuch a conſent and barmonie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring things to be fulfilled, by things that are fulfilled, that I could not haue made it clearer, if I had named the Byſhop of Rome himſelfe. And Antichriſtianity is well defined by my Apoſtle, to be not iniquitie, but the myſterie of iniquitie. For if Antichriſt had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in his owne likeneſſe, you needed not to haue beene ſo carefull about the buſineſſe. Now that hee doth inſinuate himſelfe with a counterfet holineſſe, and a diſſembled ſanctity, how many millions of innocent men hath he coſoned and deceiued with his hidden &amp; myſticall wickedneſſe? But let the viſard be taken off from this hidden Antichriſt, then none can hereafter be deceiued, but he that will wittingly and willingly be deceiued. Beware therefore that the old trickes, and ſtratagemes being laid open, beguile you no more. He faineth himſelfe to be the Prince of the couenant, and yet he hath altered my couenant: Hee pretendes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a Keeper of my will and teſtament, and yet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15182:97"/> he hath not only raced and defaced my teſtament,<note place="margin">The Pope hath altered Chriſt his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and brought in a new.</note> but hath foyſted in one of his owne. He termes himſelfe the foundation of the Church, and chalengeth to him my peculiar title, and yet hee doth with cunning deuiſes ſubuert and ouerthrow my Church. He makes a ſhew of great zeale to my croſſe, and yet doth annihilate the power of the croſſe. The holy Scripture makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods double gouernment, the Legale, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall: The legale which hath the condition of working annext vnto it, <hi>do this and thou ſhalt liue.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 31.31. Heb. 8.5. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
                  </note> The Euangelicall requireth the condition of beleeuing, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi> But it requireth faith not as a worke, but as an inſtrument, whereby you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the promiſes of the ſpirit, therefore that is called a conditionall, this a free conuenant. Where there is no couenant, there is no faith, and where there is no faith, there is no ſaluation. Humane faith doth reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an humane couenant, heauenly faith vpon a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly couenant. Heauenly faith is of two ſorts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the double couenant: One legale, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth the promiſes and threatnings of the law to bee true: the other Euangelicall, which is rightly called iuſtifying faith, which doth beleeue the promiſes of the Goſpell grounded vpon my ſelfe not onely to be true in generall, but doth apply them to euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer in particular to eternall life. Now ſaluation is to be expected of you, not out of the forme of each of theſe couenants, but out of one of them. The forme of the Legale couenant is, as I ſaid, <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt liue:</hi> the forme of the Euangelicall couenant is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeue and thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi> If therefore you looke for ſaluation out of the legall couenant, you muſt wholely and entirely, and at all times doe that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. You do it not: you ſhall die therefore. If you looke for ſaluation by the Goſpell, you muſt certainely beleeue that which is promiſed. Theſe bee the diſtinct formes of each couenant, for the procuring ſaluation,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15182:98"/> by no meanes to bee confounded, yet the Pope hath confounded them: Doe and beleeue; and ſo hath brought in a third couenant which holy writ doth not acknowledge Thus the Prince of the couenant, hath broken Gods couenant. It is not to bee denied, that faith, and good workes are to bee ioyned together in a man that is iuſtified, but to mingle and confound theſe two formes <hi>Doe this and beleeue,</hi> that thereby a man is to be iuſtified, is vtterly to bee denied, as my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath deliuered. For as the Law doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt tranſgreſſion, ſo the Goſpell doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your leaſt ſatisfaction.

So if the Pope do adde vnnaturall parts to the written will of God, hee doth corrupt Gods booke, as when he addeth Apocry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phall and decretall Epiſtles: if hee take away naturall parts he doth deceiue the ſoule of man, as when he tak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth the ſecond commandement out of the decalogue, and taketh the cuppe from the ſupper: if he open thoſe things that ſhould be ſhut, he offers wrong to God, if he ſhut vp thoſe that ſhould be opened, he offers wrong to men. The <hi>Rabins</hi> ſhall riſe vp in iudgement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne both the Pope and all Popelings, who accuſe all the written will of God of imperfection, when as they iudge the fiue bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> to bee a volume moſt perfect. They who diminiſh, adde, change euery thing at their pleaſure, ſhaue away with their cenſure what they miſlike, and what they like reſtore; that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly open ſecrets, ſo that their owne Clergie thinkes baſely of them: and of enuie ſhut vp things to be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that they bee not knowne of the people of God: They I ſay are contumelious to God, whoſe laſt will they haue either corrupted or aboliſhed. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to the ſonnes of men from whom they haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly ſtolne away, or priuily filcht away God, heauenly Legacies. Here I appeale to all learned and ingenuous Papiſts. It is no ſmale matter that is in hand, but one of the greateſt that euer was: the thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is Gods Teſtament. The legacies of all the ſonnes of God, are in queſtion, which cannot be of force vnleſſe Gods teſtament be ſafely kept. Herein the ſonnes of God muſt maintaine their right againſt men, and Diuels. Your Maſters grant that Rome is <hi>Babylon,</hi> the context and euent conuince it to be Byſhoply <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt whom my ſeruant <hi>Iohn</hi> doth denounce moſt certaine deſtruction.

               <p>The forgiuenes of ſinne is free, is perfect, is eternall. It is free: <hi>I blot out your ſinnes for my owne ſake, not for your ſakes, but for my owne names ſake. I am that lambe that was ſlaine, who alone take away your ſinnes.</hi> Are you then ſo mad that you will goe from the Lambe that is ſtaine, to the golden Calfe that is ſet vp; that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the ſinne of man can be forgiuen by the man of ſinne? The diſpenſing of grace is not in his power, much leſſe the forgiueneſſe of ſinne, which as it is free, ſo it is perfect. For I doe not remit ſome ſinnes, and reteyne others; I doe not remit the fault, and reteyne the puniſhment: but I waſh away all your ſinnes, and forgiue all your puniſhment, if your confeſſion be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, my pardon is perfect. What? Is it not alſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15182:99"/> euerlaſting?<note place="margin">Righteouſnes imputed.</note> I haue made an euerlaſting couenant with you, neuer to forſake you, euer to bleſſe you, and to ſend my feare into your hearts, that you neuer forſake me. The imputation of righteouſneſſe doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow the forgiuenes of ſinne; the grant of life, and that eternall life doth likewiſe follow imputation of righteouſnes: for he that beleeueth in the ſonne of God ſhall neuer come into condemnation, but ſhall go from death to life; and let him ſurely perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that being now iuſtified by me, and now glorified by me, that being ſaued by my grace, he ſhall ſit in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly places with me, and enioy the reall poſſeſſion of the higheſt heauens. Your ſanctification,<note place="margin">Sanctification</note> is the ſecond part of the new couenant, the beginning of your glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as your coronation hereafter is the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. For what is grace but glory begun?<note place="margin">☜</note> and what is glory but grace perfected? Eternall life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is begun in this world, and made perfect in the world to come, doth not differ in kinde, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Therefore your ſanctification is begun in this world, ſo that the relikes of ſinnes doe abide in the moſt holy, but couered; the inbred corruption did abide in <hi>Paul</hi> regenerated, but weakned; it remained in him to try him, not to deſtroy him: that corruption is remitted, not finiſhed; the guilt is releaſed, but the act remaineth. Sanctification is not therefore perfect but true, which inlightneth your mindes to true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and reformeth your wills to the ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Goſpell, and therefore doth change the whole man, both the inward and the outward man, into my likenes, by the power of my ſpirit, that beholding the ſame in the Goſpell, as in a glaſſe,<note place="margin">Glorification.</note> you may proceed from glory to glory, that is, from the glory of your ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification here, to the glory of your coronation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And herein behold how ill the Pope, and I agree.<note place="margin">How Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt diſagree.</note> I ſet before you free remiſſion, he a mercenarie: I a categoricall and abſolute, he an imperfect and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall:

I require a ſincere ſanctification of a ſinner in this life, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: hee faines a perfect holineſſe, but a counterfeit. Now your Chriſt Ieſus, as he is propounded in the free couenant, and the new teſtament, is appointed the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of the Church by the Prophets and Apoſtles, vpon whom they are taught to build their good workes, as gold, ſiluer, and pretious ſtones, as the ſuperficies fit for that golden, and pretious foundation: but they denie good workes to be the foundation it ſelfe, becauſe your workes be they neuer ſo glorious, cannot endure the weight, and burthen of the kingdom of heauen. They make Chriſt alone, euen Chriſt alone apprehended by faith, as it were that mightie <hi>Atlas,</hi> that with his ſhoulders and his power can beare vp heauen, being made of God for you wiſdome, iuſtice, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and redemption, and therefore the foundation of the whole building. Not that ſaluation is begun by him, and made perfect by you; for there is one great ſtone of the whole building, as deepeſt in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo chiefeſt in the corner; as the ground and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo the roofe and accompliſhment of ſaluation. Which your Pope hath not only deformed with wood, hay, and chaffe built vpon it, that is, with fooliſh and abſurd doctrines, differing from the foundation, but with wicked and peſtilent doctrines ouerthrowing the foundation, and by that meanes hath moſt wickedly taken away the beginning, matter, forme, inſtrument, and end of ſaluation.<note place="margin">The cauſes of ſaluation.</note> For whereas the holy Scripture doth appoint the free mercy of God, the efficient cauſe of righteouſneſſe; the meritorious my obedience both actiue and paſſiue; the formall, the imputation thereof by the Holy Ghoſt; the inſtrumentall, faith conceiued out of Gods word, founded vpon a free promiſe; the finall, the glory of Gods diuine mercy and iuſtice: when as the Pope doth ouerthrow all the foundations of ſaluation, then doth hee take and ſtop from you all

Hee doth not ſay it to him that is obedient, which is very true, but for obedience, which is very falſe: that he forſooth might ſet my gifts to ſale, and by that meanes depriue me of glory, and you of peace. From whence it doth ariſe that the Romane Antichriſt (let him pretend what he will) is a breaker of Gods couenant, a corrupter of his will, a ſubuerter of the foundation, being full of Satan, being buſie about this one thing, to bring deſtruction to my Churches, and damnation to your ſoules. Is it any maruaile then if he bring deſtruction to bodies, and ouerthrow to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires?<note place="margin">Papiſts, as Doggs.</note> when as he ſecretly ſends in his runnagate Prieſts into your Kingdomes, who as mad dogs, with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous libels may rent in ſunder the good name, and fame of Kings, &amp; bring them into hatred &amp; contempt of others. Who as ſubtle Foxes,<note place="margin">Foxes.</note> do with their cunning ſleights alienate the Kings ſubiects from the faith of their obedience due by my commandement, and to be performed by their oath.<note place="margin">Wolues.</note> And as cruell Wolues after they haue taken away the Kings good name by falſe calumniations, and drawne away the Kings ſubiects from their fealtie and obedience, doe ſpill the Kings blood by what meanes ſoeuer, either by open rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſecret conſpiracies, and defend it to be a deed moſt lawfull and meritorious. They ſhew their dogs tooth by rayling, their fox-like ſubtletie by equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and their woluiſh crueltie by conſpiring. They doe nothing elſe but deceiue the ſimple, bite them that be ſincere, and deuoure thoſe that be innocent. They pretend faith, but they teach periurie: They ſay they reconcile men to Chriſt, but in deed reconcile them to Antichriſt: in the meane while whom they get to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15182:101"/> to the Pope, they draw from the King. For while they build vp ſpirituall obedience, they caſt downe the ciuill: is not this the qualitie of a Fox? They ſet vpon thoſe that be weakeſt, that they may ouercome the ſtrongeſt, as the <hi>Serpent</hi> ſeduced <hi>Eue,</hi> that <hi>Eue</hi> might ſeduce <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo theſe Serpents ſet vpon wiues, that the wiues may deceiue their husbands; they catch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter women, that they may entangle young men, in whom is greater vigor, and heat to commit any wicked enterpriſe. So they haue a ſchoole full of maſculine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and feminine men; doth not here appeare to you the wilineſſe of the ſerpent? Now with what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous ſlanders theſe curres haue abuſed Princes, both liuing and dead, being the excellencies and glories of the earth, witnes thoſe infinite libels caſt out againſt <hi>Elizabeth Queene of England, and Iames King of Great Britaine.</hi> What maruaile is it if they raile vpon holy Doctors, that doe but write againſt them, when they reuile great Princes that can proſcribe them? But that is no maruaile, that they ſpare not the good name of a King, when they ſpare not his blood. For they be not only byting doggs, but deuouring wolues, as appeares not only by the gun-powder Treaſon, I ſhould haue ſaid the Ieſuites treaſon, but by the cruell death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third and fourth Kings of France.<note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> I am grieued at your ſluggiſhnes; I am greeued at your ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ô yee Kings and Princes, who doe endure ſuch ſowers of ſedition, ſuch teachers of periurie, ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of King-killing. Beware of theſe dogs, catch theſe foxes, driue away theſe wolues, as my ſpirit hath aduiſed you; to whom ſlandering is a ſport, conſening is a game, rebellion and conſpiracies is meat &amp; drinke. Foreſee that your patience be no longer hurtfull, both to you and me. Awake out of ſleepe at the laſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my glory together with your owne ſafetie, take the cauſe of the Goſpell in hand, and laying aſide Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, put on Chriſt Ieſus, not a falſe and a faigned Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15182:101"/> as he is deuiſed by that Apoſtata, but true and right Ieſus, as he is preached by the Apoſtle. Doe no longer hold ſhadowes for bodies, ſhewes for ſubſtances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not things vaine before thoſe that be ſound, nor things fraile before eternall. Vaine and fraile is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of Chriſt, which deceiues the eyes, ſound and eternall is the truth that feeds the ſoules: it is not the forme but the power of the Croſſe that brings ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let not the gliſtering ſhew of Antichriſt, which wrongs you being aliue, and cannot helpe you being dead, deceiue your eyes, that it may keepe you from Chriſt, from whom you may expect comfort in life, and true reſt in death. Whereby their madnes ſeemes the more, who groueling vpon the ground, ſo dote vpon Antichriſt, that they neglect the faith of Chriſt, his name onely being reteyned, who cannot feele the ſauing force of the Croſſe, nor the inward power of the Spirit, nor the heauenly light of the Goſpell, nor the ſpirituall glory of my kingdome: As if my eſtate, baſe and contemptible, in whom there is no outward forme, nor ſhew to be deſired, as my Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaid, had cauſed you to turne both your looking and your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from me: or as if I had ſuffred the moſt greeuous anguiſhes of the ſoule, and the moſt bitter tortures of the bodie for mine owne ſake, and had not been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for your tranſgreſſions, and broken for your ſins, that the chaſtiſement of your peace might reſide vpon me, and ſaluation out of my wounds and miſeries might come to you. For this is the very truth, the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the eſtate, I vndertooke,<note place="margin">☜</note> the weaknes of the fleſh I tooke on me, the ignominie of the Croſſe I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, for your ſake, ſeemes vile and contemptible in the iudgement of fleſh and blood. But if that heauenly maieſtie, if that power, if that glory, which through the vaile of humilitie, weakneſſe and ignominie is tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the eye of faith, might appeare to your mindes: euen as I am deſcribed by <hi>Iohn</hi> a lambe ſlaine, and a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15182:102"/> lyon inuincible, that ſo I may appeare to you a mighty God in the forme of a weake man. How great loue and feare, if you beleeue either a heauen or a hell, would the vniting of ſo infinite mercy with ſuch infinite power and iuſtice ſtirre vp in your ſoules? Great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſuch as commonly Kings are, had need of great grace, the preaching whereof ſhall be as acceptable to you as neceſſarie, when once you ſhall feele the ſtinge of an accuſing conſcience pricking you, whereby you might come to heauen by the way of repentance, that could not come thither by the way of innocencie. But they that vnderſtand not the force of their ſicknes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the force of the remedie. And while they feele not the wound inflicted by ſinne, they looke not for the remedie applied by grace. To whom I denounce that I will proue either a moſt louing Patron, or a moſt ſeuere Iudge, with my right hand to ſaue them, or to be reuenged on them. All men whatſoeuer they haue or are, owe it all of right to me: but Kings and Princes chiefly, whom by my ſpeciall fauour and grace I haue aduanced a few ouer ſo many millions of men, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in mine owne throne. To what end? to what end I pray? that they might giue themſelues to luſt and idleneſſe, to ſerue the Dragon, to aduance, and adorne Antichriſt? not ſo, not ſo verily. But that they may watch ouer the Church, may fight for the Lambe may ſpoile &amp; teare in pieces the Beaſt: &amp; if that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quire of Saints in heauen fall down before the lambe ſitting on his throne, and worſhip him that liues for euer, and caſt their Crownes before the throne, ſaying: <hi>Thou art worthy ô Lord to haue all glory and honor, becauſe thou haſt made all things, and being ſlaine haſt redeemed vs by thy blood vnto God.</hi> If that innumerable ranke of melodious Angels doe with ſweet and loud voices ſing of the power, wiſdome, and ſtrength of the Lambe, that is ſlaine, and giue him all honor due vnto him. What ought you to doe, you vnder whoſe purple robes, as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15182:102"/> yet abideth duſt and aſhes, and who weare but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Crownes vpon your heads, what ought yee to do in the cauſe of your King and Redeemer? for ſince I haue brought thoſe holy ſoules after the end of all their trauels &amp; dangers in my quarrell and battell, into the poſſeſſion of true happines promiſed and vowed vnto them: you that as yet are in the very heat &amp; danger of the battell, both the neceſſity of my helpe, &amp; the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance of the reward, ought to ſtir you vp to a more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent deſire to defend mine honor. Heere I haue a iuſt &amp; grieuous cauſe to complain, that your mutual ſuſpitions quarrels haue made Antichriſt, weake and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in himſelfe, to be ſo dreadfull and mighty. Hence it is that that Laterane Idoll hath taken to it ſelfe, the golden head of a ſwelling title: and ſpread abroad the ſiluer armes of his pecuniary inriſdiction: and ſtrouted out the brazen belly of conſpiracy and rebellion: and hath mooued and ſtirred from home, thoſe iron feet of violence and pride, wherewith he hath not onely trod vpon your crownes, but your neckes. I tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the diſcord of Kings hath encreaſed Antichriſt, their amity ſhall weaken him. Is it for your good to admit of ſpies, that may ſearch into your counſels? fiery ſpirits that may caſt the ſeedes of diſcord betweene neighbor-kings, and ſet them together by the eares? Harpeyes that may ſpoyle you of your treaſures? Horſe leeches that may ſucke your blood? ſecret traytors that with faire words may cut your throats? who when they haue laught at you in their ſleeues, that they haue left you lead, and taken your golde, that they may diſtract your mindes, and ſtirre them vp to make warre againſt your brethren, that thereby that Latiall <hi>Iupiter</hi> waxing great by your diſcords, may leape for cruell ioy at your miſeries and deſtructions. I appeale to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, haue you not at all times found the Popes Nuntij, Dataries and Ieſuites to be ſuch? Let there bee an end of quarrelling at the laſt, all theſe miſchiefes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:15182:103"/> ſhall bee preſently taken away, and now this ſerpent that hath ſwolne ſo bigge with diſcords to the publike hurt, ſhall be broken and conſumed. Let me therefore be a counſeller to you,<note place="margin">The duty of Kings.</note> that a true and a ſound peace being concluded among you, euerie one of you in your ſeuerall kingdomes, wherein I haue left you Kings to be my Vice-gerents, that you reſtore the true worſhip of God, renew a right faith, eſtabliſh good manners, purge the true Sacraments of the Church, call backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe the olde diſcipline brought in by the Colledge of the Apoſtles, and confirmed by the counſell of Neece.

               <p>Heere I doe ſeuerally admoniſh the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Kings &amp; Princes to beware of two counſellers, whereof I call one of them <hi>Syren,</hi> the other <hi>Erinnis. Syren</hi> doth perſwade them to follow their pleaſures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid labour, feare danger, doe not ſtirre a ſettled polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doe not break truce with their olde friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion the Pope, that they goe not about to mend any miſchiefe, that is almoſt paſt help. For they cannot, ſhe ſaith, caſt off the Pope though they would. Can they not? What cannot the arme of a King bring to paſſe, being ſtrengthened with the arme of God? from thence faith doth ariſe, from faith the magnanimity of kings, whereof that driues away blinde ſuperſtition, this baſe ſluggiſhneſſe and cowardice. That makes them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne, this makes them to withſtand all human hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ſo that they may caſt off the Pope as eaſily as an old heauy gown. It is a reproch for the Popiſh Kings to ſay, that the miſchiefe is greater then can be remedied, that as yet they cannot mend it? That they cannot caſt out the Pope if they would. Could the Princes of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:15182:103"/> Germanie, could the Kings of Denmarke, Scotland and Sueuland, that I may not ſpeake of a great part of France, Heluetia, Polonia, Bohemia, and Pannonia. The Kings of England could, the Father, the young Sonne and the Daughter, euen then when all their neighbours abroad were alienated from them, when at home they had a ſeditious cleargie, and a ſuperſtitious people, euen then did the holy courage of a Man, a Childe and a Woman breake thorow, and paſſe ouer all humane lets and impediments whatſoeuer. Let it be a ſhame for Popiſh Princes, both young men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, not to bee able to doe that which a Childe and a Woman were able to doe. But <hi>Syren</hi> perhaps will whiſper, that it is not good ſtirring of <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, beeing full of <hi>Gregories, Alexanders, Bonifaces</hi> and <hi>Iulij.</hi> O what fooliſh feare is that, ſo to take heede that they feare a miſchiefe, which when they are able to put it cleane away, they pull it and draw it vpon them? But ſome will not caſt off the Pope if they could. They think it a neceſſary euill for Kings to bridle their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and for ſubiects to bridle their Kings, To whom Chriſt doth ſeeme more hard and rigorous, as hee that neuer diſpenſeth with ſinne, and doth remit nothing, but to him that earneſtly repents. They haue neede therefore of a gentle and a cockering Antichriſt: who may diſpenſe with adultery and inceſt, and may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and allow of marriages forbidden by the Law of God. As the faſhion of the world is now adaies, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſinning; ſo ſin doth make the Pope neceſſarie. Vnhappy neceſſity, which neceſſarily brings damnation to a man. He doth worthily loue his ſinne, who while hee keepes that, loſeth his ſoule. Hee rates his ſhort life at too high a price, who that while he may liue a while after his owne luſt, doth loſe life eternall. In the meane time, while Antichriſt doth conſtraine them with ſo extreame neceſſity, what a heauy burthen doth he lay vpon them? that he ſeemeth to bind them
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15182:104"/> with linckes of golde in this life, whom he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the chaines of darkneſſe in the life to come. Theſe you ſhall eaſily breake aſunder, by the helpe of God and aſſiſtance of Proteſtant Princes. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of their religion is ſuſpected vnto vs. But this contrariety is your ſecurity: for if the Popes bee ſo ſawcy to doe ſuch things, when ſo many Princes haue forſaken the ſeat of peſtilence, what would they attempt if none at all had departed from them? for if <hi>the Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, Henries</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> did ſo eaſily puniſh the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Clements,</hi> euen in the very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of popiſh darkneſſe; if <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. did handle the <hi>Bonifaces</hi> and <hi>Iulij</hi> after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: how farre more eaſily may their poſterity with the ayde of Proteſtant Princes in ſo cleere a light of the Goſpell, tame and bring vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the fift? Eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. the preſent king of Spaine, cannot forget that his father who alwaies was the Popes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, was vnworthily and baſely abuſed by the Pope, in keeping Sicilie and Naples from him. And let the French King remember, that not onely <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. but <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. his father, was cruelly murthered by a villaine ſent in for that purpoſe. Therefore the holy courage of Proteſtant Kings, ſhould not mooue ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Popiſh Kings againſt the Kings their neighbours, but rather it ſhould ſtir vp their anger againſt the Pope, that with ioyned forces they might breake the Idols head, ſhorten his armes, pare his nailes, open his belly, cut off thoſe legs and feet, wherwith they may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their anceſtours crownes were ſo baſely caſt to the ground. You haue heard how euill <hi>Syren</hi> hath perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, now heare how farre worſe <hi>Erinnis</hi> doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them: whoſe deadly muſique, if you bee wiſe, you ſhall keepe farre off both from your mindes and eares, perſwading you, that it is fit to raiſe warre in the defence of Antichriſt, againſt your brethren and allies: for they purpoſe nothing elſe, but that their treaſure being
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15182:104"/> ſpent on both ſides, and their forces being weakened by mutuall warres, as it often hapned heeretofore, that they may build vp a chaire for the Prieſts, and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting downe the thrones of Kings, to whom it is great pleaſure to lift vp their ſhrubbe, which may ſet fire on the wood, and conſume the Cedars of Libanon. Now I tell you before hand, that you take heed of that war, which theſe holy <hi>Erinnis</hi> will cry out, and tell you, muſt bee neceſſarily made againſt my Church: for you are like to haue Chriſt himſelfe againſt you in the field. I know full well that lately at Rome, as often before; a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle of Prieſts haue bin gathered together by the Pope of Rome, and Sathans command to deface and diminiſh my glory. That they tooke counſell wherein the Popiſh Kings and Princes were in a league confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated among themſelues, againſt the Proteſtant Kings and Princes, chiefely againſt IAMES the King of Great Britanny, who concluded the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and as hee rightly inferred Popiſh Kings and Princes were the members of Antichriſt: that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe were to be maintained by common forces: that he ſent in his Prieſts who might prouoke his ſons, as hee calles them, to wage warre againſt my ſeruants. The Kings therefore of the Reformed Religion, haue more neede impoſed by Antichriſt, to fulfill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and to fight Gods warre, and vnite their forces and powers againſt that double horned Beaſt the Pope. For I thinke that popiſh Kings haue learnt more wit at the laſt, then to put in execution the bloody and cruell counſell of the Beaſt. They know that the firſt Beaſt bore it not ſcot free, whoſe ten hornes were ſayd to bee crowned, becauſe it ſpilt the innocent blood of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. For the very ſame power of the Empire, which did condemne mee being borne into the world, the Prince of your ſaluation, and faſten mee vpon the croſſe, the ſame did endeauour to ouerthrow the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church with ten perſecutions. How I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15182:105"/> the death of my Saints vpon the authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, how I did cut off ſome of the Emperors by mutuall fights, how did I comſume the people with continuall plagues, how I did deuoure the cities with floodes and earth-quakes, how I ſtrucke and diſperſed whole armies with thundrings and lightnings caſt from heauen, their ſtories doe well declare. As many creatures as I had, ſo manie viols I had of my raging wrath, which I pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon mine and my ſeruants enemies. But ſome of you will ſaie, Thoſe were Pagans that did kill, and Chriſtians that were killed: wee are Catholikes which doe puniſh, they are heretickes which are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed They are as certainly hereticks as you are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks. You Catholiks? I wold you were Chriſtians, they be not words, but deeds muſt make this good. You carrie the name of Chriſt, I confeſſe: but you plaie the Pagans vnder the name of Chriſt. Are they heretickes? True as I am an hereticke, that call all things to the rule of the Word. But Antichriſt doth alleadge Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: true, as the Diuell did alleadge them miſvnderſtood. Who as he enticed the Iewes to kill me, ſhadowed out and promiſed in the Propheticall Scriptures, to bee the Meſſias, ſo he hath moued manie Catholikes in name, in truth moſt hereticall heretickes, the bond ſlaues of Antichriſt, to burne both my ſeruants and their books, and they blot out as much as lay in them, by their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and their power, the faith and the Church, whoſe quarrell I often reuenged with a high hand ſtretched from heauen. I will giue you one notable example After that the Counſell of Conſtance had condemned to the fire, thoſe two my ſeruants, <hi>Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Hierome,</hi> the Pope ſent two Erinnes into Germanie, the <hi>Cardinall of Wincheſter,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall of Saint Angelo:</hi> who when they had called backe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour, from making warre againſt the Turkes, they incited him to beare armes againſt the Bohemians, the new profeſſours of my Goſpell, and brought into the field
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:15182:105"/> three other great Germane Princes, with all their forces: will you heare the iſſue of their whole fight &amp; paſſage? The <hi>Bohemians</hi> leuy an armie, come into the fielde, ſtrike vp the alarum, they had ſcarce come to handy gripes, but the King, and the Princes being ſtroke with a cauſleſſe ſuddaine feare, in their rage crying out to their ſouldiers to ſtand to it and fight did cowardly and beaſtly flie away: fiue times they made inrodes into <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> and fiue times they were diſcomfited. And ſo not long after three ſeuerall Popes the Authors of this tragedy, and thoſe two diuiliſh Cardinalls not without great ſhame, and ſorrow came to a fearefull end. In all which occurrences hee that doth not behold the hand of God, is blinde, he that doth not feare it is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. I paſſe ouer that inuincible Spaniſh Armado, which being gathered together by the inſtigation of Prieſts, was diſperſed by the windes, ſwallowed vp by the ſeas, and brought to confuſion by the hand of God. What? do you thinke that Gods hand is ſhortened? or doe you thinke that God hath left off to defend his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants? Infinite be the examples of Gods power, which God hath ſhewed both in former ages, and often in this preſent age in the defence of the Church againſt her mightieſt enemies. Let thinges to come be taught by things paſt. And if thoſe former tyrants, or thoſe that followed had gone vnpuniſhed for their wickedneſſe, there had beene cauſe for Antichriſt, with all his facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to haue reioyced in their ſinne: there had beene ſome reaſon, that the Kings of the earth had promiſed to themſelues impunitie, who had beſtowed all their might, in building vp and enlarging the Kingdome of the two horned beaſt. Now that I haue firſt crackt and broken to peeces the ten crowned and bloody hornes, and after haue ſcattered both by land and ſea the ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie ſlaues of the ſecond beaſt, what at laſt ſhall become of Antichriſt is declared in the ſixt ſeale. But what in the mean time may Antichriſts ſouldiers hope for, who
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15182:106"/> being ſet on fire by theſe fire brandes did turne all their forces to do miſchiefe? I doe aduiſe you therefore, yee popiſh Kings and Princes, that ye depart out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as faſt as you can, then that being conuerted to me, you make warre with vnited forces in the quarrell of the Church againſt Antichriſt, at leaſt that you giue no eare to theſe <hi>Syrenes</hi> or <hi>Erinnes</hi> which will bring deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both to your ſoules and bodies. On my word the Byſhoppe of Rome, and the great Antichriſt are termes conuertible. The decree of God ſtandes faſt for euer, that the Byſhoppe ſhall be conſumed by thoſe Kings, by whom he was adored. You cannot ſerue mee and the Pope, with whom peace being made by you, ſee if it be not to be called peace rather then a compact of ſlauerie. From whence if I cannot drawe the popiſh Kings and Princes, I will for all that warne you yee Kings and Princes Proteſtants, that you preferre a holy warre before a wicked league with the Pope, and think thoſe armes to be holy, when there is no hope left but in armes. And take heede that being deceiued with an opinion of a falſe peace you bee not on a ſuddaine brought to ruine. I wiſh you may bee at peace with neighbour Kings, and neighbour Kings with you, but at no hand haue peace with the Romane Antichriſt. Why ſo? it is wicked; it is dangerous, it cannot hold. It is wicked; what peace, what conſent, what agreement can be with the holy ſcriptures and mans traditions, with free will and Gods grace, with inherent iuſtice, and imputed righteouſneſſe, with mans ſatisfactions and my blood procuring their ſaluation? what holy ſociety and vnity can there bee with the inuocation of dead Saints, and the prayers to the liuing God, with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Maſſe and the Lords ſupper, with Chriſtian faith and Antichriſtian diſtruſt? You ſee it is wicked, now marke how dangerous. Sweete is the name of peace &amp; the opinion of vnitie is delightſome. But what true Chriſtian doth doubt, that that bond of peace is moſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15182:106"/> ſure, which is knit together with the truth and vnitie of the Spirit. Whence it followeth that ſweete deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is included in that peace which is made with falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. I adde that there cannot poſſibly bee peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeede of the woman and the ſeede of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: betweene the lambe and Antichriſt: betweene thoſe where God hath ſet euerlaſting hatreds. Fire and water will better agree then Chriſt and Antichriſt: wherefore I aduiſe Proteſtant Kings and Princes, that they make perfect that reformation of the Church by my helpe, which by my helpe they haue begunne. Firſt that they compoſe all home differences chiefly in the Articles of the doctrine of the Goſpell with quiet and Chriſtian conference: for it is to bee feared that inward diſſention will bring backe againe the outward enemy. Secondly, that they reſiſt the common Aduerſarie with common helpe and counſell, for there is danger that if euery one reſiſt not, all will be ſurpriſed. Thirdly, that they may the better defend their Chriſt, let them at once ſet vpon Antichriſt: for hee hath more courage that doth inuade, then he that doth defend. Laſtly if they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in all points fulfil the prophecy, yet let them baniſh the beaſt out of their Dominions. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Chriſt and Antichriſt ſhould dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the end I aduiſe both ſides that in the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this great buſineſſe they preferre not worldly wiſedome, before heauenly wiſedome, ſecondly that the euill cuſtome of men, bee not preiudiciall to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall truth of God. Thirdly, that ſluggiſh doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do not put of, and procraſtinate this ſo noble and ſo worthy an enterpriſe. Laſtly that the deceitfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of peace with Antichriſt, doe not croſſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of recouering libertie. So that euery one of you being content with his own kingdome and territories, ſhall not buſie himſelfe about inuading others, but will caſt about how he may preuaile and ouerthrow the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and his eldeſt ſonne the Romane Antichriſt, i. not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15182:107"/> one wicked man, but all the Kingdome of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Euery one of you haue a iuſt cauſe of his owne, and now you haue a faire offer made you. The truce made betweene <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the <hi>Turke,</hi> offers a fit occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repreſſe the inſolencie of this Biſhoppe after you will more eaſily repell the Turke. And ſeeing you haue both a iuſt quarrell, and fit oportunitie againſt the beaſt, let there not be wanting a will in you.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt the Sauiour, ô ye renowmed Kings and Princes do ſpeake thus ſecretly vnto you, and inwardly warne you, ſhall he not perſwade you, though he were not of power to puniſh you? The rather ſeeing he hath ſhewed, that the Pope is a Capitall enemie to Gods te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and kingly gouernment. The Pope hath caſt ſuch proiects, and Rome takes ſuch counſells that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maieſtie, and popelike Maieſtie cannot long ſtand together. Our ſinnes makes the Biſhoppe great, who if he riſe to that greatneſſe which hee aimeth at in his minde, Kings of neceſſitie muſt fall to the ground. My Dialogue ſhall make it plaine, if it pleaſe you to vouchſafe to read it, wherein pragmaticall Antichriſt firſt enters the ſtage.</p>

This bitter cup the Pope hath mingled for you <hi>Calander</hi> and <hi>Argentine,</hi> and the reſt of the Lay-Papiſts. The <hi>Ieſuite</hi> hath wiſht it to you, who being the Popes intelligencer, ſignified that the power of the Engliſh Papiſts was greater then the Proteſtants, if hee would that outward forces were ioyned with them: as <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> writes that the <hi>Burgundian</hi> ſpies being deceiued with the miſt and darkneſſe of the night, deceiued the Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> telling him that the forces of France, were greater and neerer, when as they tooke the longer bryars and brambles in the field, for iauelins &amp; lances. So the falſe reports of the Ieſuites, deceiued the Biſhop, whereby he tooke raſh and vntimely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to ſend his Bulls vnto you. Hence the Pope, as <hi>Pius</hi> the fift had done before him, compiled an horned argument, wherewith hee ſtrooke his ſonnes on both ſides, and droue them to that exigent, that either they muſt runne vpon the point of the Queenes law, if they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15182:110"/> obeyed not the King, or incurred the Popes curſe, if they obeyed him. For he driues them (whoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vndertaken for the Catholike faith, he doth miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deplore) either to hell, or the gallowes. For of neceſſitie they muſt either be damnde, or hangd, if you beleeue the Pope, damned vnleſſe they obey the inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or hangd if they obey it. Is this the ſaluation of <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>fift</hi> that he ſendeth to his ſonnes? is this his Apoſtolicall bleſſing? Doth the pitifull Father thus bleſſe his ſonnes that haue hitherto endured ſo great afflictions for reteyning, as he writes, the Catholike faith?

Therefore <hi>let the ſoule be ſubiect to the higher power</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Hence two other parts of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection doe neceſſarily follow; <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle doth adde the reaſons with a commandement, which <hi>Paul</hi> the Byſhoppe doth not adde with his prohibition.

To ſhew that hee rather reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15182:115"/> the right of gouerning, then the qualitie of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.

Neither is it from the people as diuers flatterers of the people doe at this day ſtriue for it. I beleeue they leaue the power of deſtroying a gouernment to him, whom they dreame to haue a power giuen to build it vp. They that yeeld ſo much to the Pope, ſubiect a King vnder a ſober tyrant, they that yeeld ſo much to the people, ſubiect him vnder a furious tyrant, and as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid very wittily and truely, <hi>to a beaſt of many heads.</hi> And therefore the King is not bound to giue accompt either to Pope or people, but to God, from whom hee receiued all his power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Hence the Apoſtle preſently inferreth theſe two concluſions: 1. He that reſiſteth Gods power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and draweth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe damnation. The 2. that the King is Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and beareth the ſword, wherewith he doth defend the good, and puniſh the wicked, and that all muſt bee ſubiect, not for wroth, but for conſcience. That no man may thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> thought that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was due for the times ſake, and that they wanted force rather to reſiſt <hi>Nero,</hi> then a minde. I will ſhut vp all in a word. The Catholicke faith of the auncient Romane Church, as it was deliuered by <hi>Paul</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle, did inferre loyall ſubiection to a Pagan cruell King. The Catholicke faith of the vpſtart Church of Rome, as it is deliuered by <hi>Paul</hi> the Byſhop doth take away and ouerthrow Allegeance and all obedience as it were vnnaturall, from a Chriſtian King, and ſuch a King that euen by the confeſſion of his Aduerſaries is very mercifull. Whom then ſhall we beleeue? <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, or <hi>Paul</hi> the Byſhop, an holy decree, or an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy prohibition? Neither were theſe commandements of Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> of ciuill obedience to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Emperours, Kings, and ciuill Magiſtrates, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Laſt of all whatſoeuer hee attempted was with the Kings authoritie, and with the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and conſent of all the nobility. For he conuented all the captaines and cheife Fathers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> vnto him into the houſe of God, and made a couenant with them, and exacted an Oath of them in the houſe of God, and ſhewed the kings ſonne vnto them.

But <hi>Ahab</hi> if <hi>Elias</hi> had not vrgd him, had not ſlaine them.

               <p>For whenas a greeuous famine grew vpon them, and that no raine could fall, but at the word of <hi>Elias,</hi> as hee had foretold <hi>Ahab</hi> before the drought; being accuſed to <hi>Ahab</hi> to be the procurer of the famine, and troubler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> defendeth himſelfe, and teſtifieth before the king, that God had ſent that plague vpon all <hi>Iſrael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he and his Fathers houſe had forſaken the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and worſhipped ſtrange Gods.</hi> And to make his word good, he offered before all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> vpon paine to looſe his head, that the king and his people were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts, and that he would make it plain by a miracle, that is with fire ſent downe from heauen, which ſhould make it appeare whoſe ſacrifice God did

The King accepts the condition, all the reſt giue their conſents, and when they plainly perceiued by the miracle of <hi>Elias,</hi> that the <hi>Baalites</hi> were conuicted to be the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and ſhould haue caſt downe themſelues vpon their faces, and giuen glorie to God, as the people did, and ſhould moſt humbly haue ſubmitted them-ſelues to the truth of God: <hi>Elias</hi> did aduiſe them, to lay hands on the <hi>Baalites,</hi> and to puniſh them with death by Gods law, due to ſuch ſeducers and deceiuers. So <hi>Elias</hi> perſwaded <hi>Ahab</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to conſent to the ſlaughter of the <hi>Baalites</hi> with a publike decree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the conſent of the King, the decree of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in ſo extreame neceſſitie, by ſo notable a miracle wrought by the Prophet, not by <hi>Elias</hi> hand, but by his perſwaſion, the people did in publike place put to death thoſe <hi>Baalitiſh</hi> impoſtors, according to the law of God publikely convicted. How can you draw this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to your purpoſe? Will you reaſon after this man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner?

As <hi>Ludonicus Richeomus</hi> hath it in his Apologeticke. Theſe agree with the canon: <hi>Render,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to Caeſar, the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that

Now ſeeing I perceiue that <hi>Chriſt, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> not only taught, but ſhewed ciuill obedience to <hi>Tiberij</hi> and <hi>Neroes,</hi> and to be ſo farre from taking from them with their diuine power, as they might, their ſcepter, ſword and Crowne, that vnder them they laid downe their life to confirme their faith and obedience. You haue ſaid that which makes me begin to doubt, of ſuch force of excommunication, and ſuch power of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when I did diligently obſerue euery paſſage of your diſputation <hi>Patriotta,</hi> out of that perſpicuous and ſhort expoſition, &amp; as it were conſiſting of thoſe three texts, I muſt needes confeſſe, that the ſparkes of this vnknowne, and vnhard of truth, did firſt caſt them ſelues into mine eyes, wherewith the authoritie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas, Toletane,</hi> and <hi>Laterane Councell</hi> for their power of excommunication, and the authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> alleaged by <hi>Saturnine,</hi> preſently brought a mvſt ouer them. But light was brought out of the myſt by <hi>Friſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſhergenſis, Sigebert,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and all the ancient and ſincere Catholikes, and graue witneſſes of thoſe times, as I heare my <hi>Velbacellus</hi> affirme, at what time <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. did firſt attempt to driue <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. Emperor by his excommunication out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Here <hi>Saturnine</hi> being driuen from humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, betooke himſelfe to diuine. But whatſoeuer he tooke, <hi>Patriotta</hi> ſtraight-way caught it out of his hands; where hee ſaid that the Apoſtle forbad wee ſhould not ſalute an heretike, and commanded to auoide him after one or two admonitions; <hi>Patriotta</hi> made anſwer, that hee forbad voluntarie ſocietie, not neceſſarie ſubiection, priuate familiaritie, not publike
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15182:138"/> obedience. And when he preſt that a gangrene was to be cut of, he inſtantly replyed, that it was not an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, but hereſie was compared to a gangrene, and with a religious kinde of charitie, (as it ſeemde) ſparing the heretike, thought good the hereſie ſhould be rooted out. And from thence in my iudgement concluded not amiſſe, when no heretike was to looſe his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or his life, that a King much leſſe was to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued either of his life or inheritance by reaſon of hereſie. Here <hi>Saturnine</hi> bent all the force of his wit, and betaking himſelfe into the fortifications of the old Teſtament, from euery place gathering the forces of examples, with arguments drawne from thence fought very valiantly, ſo that when I heard him alone, he made me conſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vnto him. But this heretike <hi>Patriott,</hi> ſhrunke not a foote, but preſently buckled hand to hand. He had ſaid that <hi>Saul</hi> was depoſed, <hi>Patriot</hi> as the truth was diſtinguiſhed, that the perſon of <hi>Saul</hi> was not remoued from the poſſeſſion of the kingdome, but his of-ſpring from the ſucceſſion. But by whom? euen from GOD, not from <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom hee proued to be not a Iudge, but a meſſenger, nor to haue inflicted the puniſhment of depoſing, but to haue publiſhed the decree, and that not by the right of his generall vocation, but by ſpeciall inſtinct and reuelation from God, not as Prophet, but as a Prophet appointed to that end, to annoint <hi>Dauid</hi> for the ſucceſſion of the kingdome, whom God had named with his owne mouth. So that nothing can accrue to the <hi>Pope</hi> from hence, vnleſſe he can proue he haue receiued a reuelation to depoſe a <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When hee contended that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was caſt aſide <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>68</label> by the <hi>Prophet,</hi> he againe denied it, confeſſing hee was greeuouſly reproued by the <hi>Prophet,</hi> not violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturnine</hi> aſſaults againe, that <hi>Ozias</hi> a Leper was by force driuen out of the Temple, by <hi>Azaria</hi> and 80. <hi>Priests,</hi> and that he was ſeparated from the ſocietie of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:15182:139"/> men, and the gouernment committed to <hi>Iothan</hi> his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Patriott,</hi> a better Text-man as it ſeemeth, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the King was put out of the Church forceably, but being ſtrooke with a leproſie, was enforced by his owne accord to depart out of the Sanctuarie, not out of the kingdome; the right whereof hee reſerued to himſelfe to his dying day, and put ouer the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his ſonne as to his Vicegerent. And that a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per neuer loſt his priuate inheritance, much leſſe his publike. And when as hereſie is a leproſie, nor euer any was depriued of his kingdome for leproſie, and therefore for hereſie none was to be depriued. Which reaſon muſt needs ſatisfie me in this buſineſſe, vnleſſe it can be proued that the leprous <hi>Iewes</hi> loſt their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Saturnine</hi> affirmed that the lepers were ſeparated from the company of men by the Prieſts, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotta</hi> excepted againſt it, that it was their duty to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne the leproſie, but the Magiſtrates were to put them apart. So that the iudgement of the buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Preiſts, the parting of the perſon to the Magiſtrate. Whence he concluded and retorted it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saturnine,</hi> who ſayd that hereſie was a ſpirituall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, that it followed from this figure, that the King ought rather to ſeparate an hereticall Pope, then the Pope an hereticall king. So that this figure was more hurtfull to the Pope then to the King.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>69</label> One thing there was which both <hi>Patriott</hi> did ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-enforce againſt you <hi>Saturnine,</hi> and did likewiſe mightily offend vs all, when you concluded out of <hi>Azarias</hi> example, that it was lawfull for Preiſts to take armes to repreſſe the wickedneſſe of Kings, for the Preiſt reſiſted the King not with arms, but with words: vnleſſe perhaps you will take a greeuous admonition, reproofe and reprehenſion for armes. <hi>Azarias</hi> did not caſt the king out of the temple, much leſſe out of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:15182:139"/> kingdome. And doe you thinke of corſlets, ſwords, and lawnces, wherewith a warlike Preiſt may remooue a King from his throne? fie vpon this proud vanitie. A Biſhop ought not to bee a ſtriker, much leſſe a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. It was not lawfull for <hi>Dauid</hi> to build vp Gods materiall Temple, becauſe he was a man of bloud, and will you build vp Gods ſpirituall Temple with bloudy hands? But I referre you to the canons, and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>For where you ſayd that <hi>Athalia</hi> was lawfully depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>70</label> by <hi>Iehoida</hi> the Preiſt, it was firſt anſwered, that ſhee was neuer rightly created and crowned. Againe, that ſhe was depoſed by <hi>Iehoida,</hi> not as hee was high Preiſt, but cheife Prince of his tribe, and next allie to the king, nor by himſelfe alone, but ioyned with all the Nobles of the kingdome: not with the authority of the Preiſt, but by the authority of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> being firſt annoynted and crowned by him: that whatſoeuer he did, he ſeemed to doe by the power of the king, with the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Peeres and Nobles againſt the wicked vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Kingdome, which had murthered all the Kings Progeny. What is this to the Pope, that hee may depoſe a lawfull Prince with his Biſhoply autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
               <p>And whereas you propounded <hi>Elias</hi> zeale to bee imitated by you, <hi>Patriott</hi> anſwered truely, that your zeale was too fiery, and would proue too prepoſterous, vnleſſe you could prooue you had <hi>Elias</hi> ſpeciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
               <p>And when you ſaid that <hi>Achab</hi> was remooued from his Kingdome by <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Elizeus:</hi> it is partly true, partly falſe. It is true that you ſay, he was remooued, but by <hi>Iehu</hi> whom one of the ſonnes of the Prophets did annoynt by Gods ſpeciall commandement, which God gaue to <hi>Elizeus,</hi> that <hi>Iehu</hi> ſhould roote out all the poſterity of <hi>Achab.</hi> Hee was not therefore depoſed by <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Elizeus,</hi> but by <hi>Iehu,</hi> whom God had raiſed vp
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15182:140"/> by name extraordinarily for that purpoſe. Neither did the ſonne of the Prophet, when hee annoynted <hi>Iehu,</hi> beginne thus, thus ſayth <hi>Elizeus,</hi> but thus ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>This doth no whit help the popes cauſe, that <hi>Patriott</hi> did ſomtime ſcatter abroad your arguments, as brooms that are not bound together: and enforced him as a cripple with a broken legge to halt now vpon one leg, now vpon both, both in his antecedent and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: as if the antecedent retained neither truth in the matter, or Law in the forme, and the conſequent had loſt all the neceſſity of proofe. So that you neither did helpe the popes power, or ſatisfie our conſciences.</p>
               <p>For it was to no purpoſe, as he rightly ſaid, to ſeeke for cauſes at the laſt, why princes ſhould in fact be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by preiſts and prophets, when you cannot proue that any was depoſed.</p>

               <p>Heere when you did enforce the couenant between God and the King, your ready aduerſary did demand, if the King breake any of the articles of agreement, who would enter ſuite againſt him? or in what court or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory were hee to bee accuſed?

What you! doe you thinke theſe to be Heretickes, as lately you tearmed <hi>Sigebert</hi> and <hi>Vincentius?</hi> what maruell is it if ſtrangers accuſe the Pope, when his owne condemne him? if his enemies ſet vpon him, when his friends forſake him? if the late Catholickes leaue him, when the ancient for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him?

               <p>But truely <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Carerius</hi> with all their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe flatter the Pope more groſly, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with his cunning oppoſition flatters him more ſmoothly, being the more dangerous enemie to Kings, becauſe the more cloaſe. But that I often obſerued the witty

               <p>But that England &amp; Ireland are portions of <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony, and the Biſhop of Romes temporalties, it is plaine by the articles of agreement betweene <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the third, Pope of Rome, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, King of England, agreed on in the yeere of the Lord 1171. who when he was abſolued by the Pope, for the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> did couenant that <hi>none ſhould afterward accept that Crowne of right, or ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for King, till hee had his confirmation from the cheefe paſtour of our ſoules.</hi> Which couenant was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the yeere 1210. by <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of England, who had confirmed the ſame by oath to <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> the Popes Legate, at the requeſt of the Barons and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as a matter of great importance, to preſerue the common-weale, to keepe it from the vniuſt vſurpation of Tyrants, and to auoyd other miſcheefes, whereby before they had ſmarted, and to preuent that they fall not into the like againe, by the default of any wicked King thereafter.

For when as the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhop of Chicheſter, had plainely ſhewed againſt <hi>Tortus,</hi> or rather counterfet <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creede was ſet foorth, whereto <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle before his martyrdom had added the Article of Chriſt, before the departure of the Apoſtles from Ieruſalem: and therefore before S. <hi>Peter</hi> came to Rome, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 44.</note> and had concluded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily from thence, that the Catholike faith was fully finiſhed before the Apoſtolike See was begunne: hence it is ſaid, there aroſe a doubt in that right honourable <hi>Calanders</hi> conſcience, a Papiſt, but very moderate and honeſt, not onely of the ſupremacie of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of that depriuing power annexed to the ſupremacy, but of all the whole Romiſh Catholike faith, which he ſaw was contained in the popiſh, not Apoſtolicall, Nycene, or Conſtantinopolitane Creede.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>125</label> Therefore when thoſe former learned men together with <hi>William Argentine,</hi> came againe to viſite him: It is very well ſayd <hi>Calander,</hi> that you are met againe to diſcuſſe before vs a verie difficult controuerſie, of the popes new creede, which <hi>Pius</hi> the fouth had formerly
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15182:163"/> compiled, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. comanded it lately to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: my good freind <hi>Argentine</hi> hath lately recited it, and I hope by and by he will recite the ſame to you. This being preſcribed by the Church; vtterly to reiect it, I doe as yet (to ſpeake truely) make a conſcience: and to admit it wholly, vnleſſe it bee ratified by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the holy Scripture, I cannot admit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple of conſcience. For I haue lately learned to giue attendance to the holy Scripture, which holy S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth directly affirme to bee as a candle lightned in this life, to vs wandring in darkneſſe,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> Which holy <hi>Paul</hi> doth likewiſe make the foundation of the Church,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.20. 1. Tim. 3.15.</note> and yet I cannot depart raſhly from the Catholike Church, whereto I haue beene accuſtomed, which the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> calles the piller and ground of truth, by which there is a creede of faith ſet out for me. So I hang doubtfull betweene the Scripture &amp; the Church, which God hath giuen vnto vs, as the Sunne and Moone, the two great lights to giue vs light to life.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Patriott:</hi> you ſay right <hi>Calander,</hi> ſaid he, in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>126</label> generall, that as the Sunne and Moone, ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Church, as two lights, ſhew light vnto vs,<note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Sun &amp; Moon.</note> but that you erre in the ſpeciall, as after it ſhall better appeare.</p>
               <p>But the holy Scripture hath light in it ſelfe as the Sunne, the Church is a light, but borrowed from the Scripture, as the Moone from the Sun; &amp; theſe two, I confeſſe, are giuen vs of God to direct vs vnto eternall life. But the Scripture directs vs with maſterly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Church with her miniſtery: for the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the wiſdome of God in Chriſt, inſpired from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue into holy men, for the eternall ſaluation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Church, as the Apoſtle hath defined it. God hath commended the Scripture to the Church,<note place="margin">The office of the Church.</note> as an heauenly charge, that it may diſcerne, expound, keep and publiſh it to men: the Scripture is therefore mens maſter, but the Church is Gods miniſter. Therefore
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15182:164"/> the Apoſtle calles the truth the foundation of the Church, and the Church the piller of truth, as <hi>Salomon</hi> made his chariot to haue a golden axtree, and pillers of ſiluer, vnderſtanding by the axetree, the ſound doctrin of the Meſſias, by the pillers, the faithfull teachers of the ſame.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>127</label> It is a wicked thing therefore to detract from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of the holy Scripture, and it is vniuſt to derogate from the miniſtery of the true Church: for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the truth of God:<note place="margin">The office of the Scripture.</note> and the Church is the houſe of God: the truth is the golden foundation of this houſe: and this houſe is the ſiluer piller of this truth, that is, cut out of the truth, as out of the rocke, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> obſerueth. So if the Scripture be the baſe of the Church, then the Church is the piller of the word, as he ſpake very wittily. Now reaſon teacheth, that the foundation is not ſuſtained by the houſe, but the houſe by the foundation. And religion concludes from thence, that truth makes the Church, not the Church the truth. For the approbation of the truth is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cauſe of the Church. For before it do approue the written word of God, it is but a company of Infidels and Idolaters: after it hath approoued it, it beginneth to be the familie of the faithful worſhippers of God, that is, a Church. Further, although the Church by the Spirit doe diſcerne the true Scripture from the falſe: yet the Scripture being once knowen and acknowledged, as before it made, ſo after it ſheweth the Church. For what more certain note can there be of ſhewing a thing, then the working cauſe of the thing? Againe, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge ſoeuer the Church doth rightly challenge to it ſelfe, it receiued from the Scripture, as that which cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth the Church the piller of truth. Therefore the truth of the Scripture is more ancient in time, more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the light, and greater for authority then the Church; which when it once receiueth her eſſence, light and power from the Scripture, then at laſt, as a piller, it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15182:164"/> vpholdeth with her miniſtery the truth in reſpect of men, and reueales it to the inhabitants of the earth: and it is that ground whereon men both may and ought to leane and reſt.<note place="margin">Lawes vpon pillers, ſo the Scriptures on the Church.</note> Whereupon the Propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall doctrine is ſaid to bee the foundation of the Church, the Church is the ſtrength of doctrine, not the foundation. It is euident therfore, that the Church is founded and ſuſtained by the truth, and that the truth is ſuſtained and reuealed by the Church once founded, as it were, a watch-tower for trauellers, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them into heauen. The Heathens were wont to write their lawes in tables, and hang them vp vpon pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to bee read of the people. The Apoſtle deſcribing the Church, compareth it to ſuch a piller, the vſe wherof was to ſhew the Law, when it ſelfe was not the Law. So the true, Orthodoxe and Catholike faith being written in the tables of the Scripture, is faſtned to the Church, as it wereto a moſt beautifull piller, as a moſt ſtrong prop, which reſteth vpon it, not with its owne, but a borrowed ſtrength. Wherefore the Apoſtle in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Epheſians defines the Church, when in the ſecond to Timothie, hee deſcribes it. For there hee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth from the cauſes, heere from the effects, in each place he vnderſtandeth the Church of Epheſus, that is, a particular Church. In the firſt place he teacheth what made that, in the ſecond what that did: nor ſo much, what it alway doth (for of neceſſitie the foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, the Church muſt fall, as it happened firſt to the Church of Epheſus, and afterward to the Church of Rome) as what it ought to doe. For this is rather an admonition then a commendation, and with a praiſe giueth warning of duty. Wherefore you ſhall doe well, <hi>Calander,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> warnes you, if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies giue attention to the holy Scripture, as to the candle: to the Church, as to the candle-ſticke, ſo long as it containeth and vpholdeth that candle, giuing light to all the houſe. For if it bee bereft of the light of her
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15182:165"/> ſunne, and being blinde endeauours to make others blinde alſo, while it makes new Articles of the faith, and conceales the old: it doth retain the name of a Church, but it hath altogether loſt the nature, that which may very truely be ſpoken of the Church of Rome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Why then good Sir, why do you vrge this place of the keyes any more for the ſupremacie, whereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was promiſed more to Peter than was granted to all the Apoſtles, as the Fathers both old and new, both ſtrangers and your owne do apprarantly proue?</p>
               <p>But in this place, becauſe to feed is the ſame with to rule, and Peter alone is commanded to feed the ſheep, not ſome, but all; therefore to Peter alone is giuen the principalitie ouer the whole Church, being armed with a double ſword, with a double power, ſpirituall and temporall, which the old man ſaw, I beleeue, as lunatike <hi>Pentheus</hi> by fitts ſaw,
<q>Two ſeuerall Sunnes, two ſeuerall Moones appeare.</q> which the Fathers both old and new, being of a more ſetled wit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> pride in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall equall to a King.</note> and ſharper inſight could neuer ſee. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinketh ſo gaily of the paſtorall vocation, that in reſpect thereof he preferreth a Biſhop before a King, as a ſheepheard before a ſheepe: which perhaps he had well concluded, if Chriſt had ſaid to Peter, <hi>Feed thy ſheepe;</hi> he ſaid it not, but <hi>feede my ſheepe.</hi> But he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15182:173"/> doth not only prefer a Biſhop before a King, but makes a Cardinall equall with him very fondly. The Biſhop of Ely, was ſomtime Cardinall of <hi>S. Pauls Church,</hi> as now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is Cardinall of the Church of Rome. Yet notwithſtanding being as well learned, hee would not compare himſelfe for modeſtie ſake with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, when well he might. For though as he is Biſhop of Ely, he is inferior to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> yet as he was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>S. Pauls Church</hi> he was nothing inferior. And yet the Cardinall is ſo mad, as to compare himſelfe to the King the Biſhop of Elies Lord. But let vs returne to the argument.</p>

Let Peter bee changed into chaire, and the maſculine gender into the feminine.

Goe to, and what if one ſhould demand of <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, by what right hee holdeth his Popedome, he will anſwer as he is taught, not by the title of mans election: but by the Law, forſooth, of God. Therfore the Popes power is by Gods Law, as it ſeemeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his election bee by the Cardinals. Why then may not the Kings power be by the Law of God, thogh his ſucceſſion be from his anceſtours? for whoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemes to be like, why ſhould their iuriſdiction be diſlike?

As if in our dayes a Clergie man were brought to the bar of a Secular Iudge vnder the name and habite of a Lay-man, hee may be condemned by that power wherewith a Laicke may, out of the ignorance of the Iudge; yet it doth not follow thereby that Clarkes by law are ſubiect to the iudgement of Lay-men, or that Chriſt was ſubiect to the iudgment of Pilate.</hi> Thus far Bellarmine.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, wee brought into open view, not only the doctrine and practiſe of Chriſt and Peter, that the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe hath reproued this ſupremacie, which the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall ſenſe of the Scripture did not proue, and that literall ſenſe is confirmed not only by the teſtimonie of the ancient Fathers and Doctors of our owne ſide, but by the teſtimonie of the very Papiſts themſelues. So that this tower of Babylon being not only bereft of her rotten weake vpholders, but being alſo thruſt at by our ſtrongeſt engines, that is, by the decrees of the Church, and oracles of ſcripture, muſt needs be ſhaken in peeces and fall to the groud.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſupremacie of <hi>Peter</hi> that in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> iudgement is a tranſcendent thing aboue all, by the cenſure of the Scripture is nothing at all: and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Pope, is not from the inſtitution of Chriſt, as they ſay, but from the fact of Peter: and this fact is proued not by any certaine reuelation, but by an vncertaine viſion. Behold why the primacie of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in <hi>Tortus</hi> did vaunt that this article of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith had a ſure ground in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And now marke, <hi>Calander,</hi> to what paſſe all <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> deuiſes are brought. The depoſing of a King hangeth on the excommunication of the Pope; the power of excommunication is vnited to the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, the ſupremacie hath the beginning from a Primate, but the Primate though hee be narrowly fought for, yet cannot poſſibly be found in the text. Where is then the ſupremacie? where is the power of excommunicating Kings? where is the right of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them? Truly your Primate hath either a bad title or a bad Patron. But the Patron is ſaid to be very good: therefore the title is very bad. But the Papiſts will accept any thing at his hands as he hopeth, with whom if hee preuaile in this cauſe, it is more for the credulitie of the Readers, than the wiſdome of the Writer.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>Regius;</hi> The ſupremacie being ouer-turned, that double power which is ſo annexed to the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie muſt needs be ouer-turned, the ſpirituall and the temporall. The ſpirituall, whereby as a Biſhop by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication hee thinks hee may driue from their kingdomes, Kings that are in oppoſition, whether He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes or Roman-Catholikes: The temporall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be direct or indirect, whereby hee may as the chiefe ſpirituall Prince take the Crowne from one, and beſtow it at his pleaſure vpon another.

This great Sophiſter, when the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> purpoſed to ſhoot his venemous arrow at the head of the Prince, he bent the Popes bowe with this double power, as it were with a double ſtringe, that if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall did faile, the ſpirituall ſhould hit him home. Which if I ſhould not accompt holy as the deſire of gold is holy, I ſhould lye.
